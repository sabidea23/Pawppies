1,"The Affenpinscher is square-proportioned, compact and sturdy, with medium bone. This breed is a smaller version of a working terrier, and as such is not a delicate dog. This is an active, tough dog that is agile enough to catch and dispatch rodents. The gait is light, sound, and confident. The Affenpinscher has a monkey-like facial expression with long eyebrows and beard, which lends an air of comic seriousness. The rough coat is about 1 inch long on the body, somewhat longer on the head, neck, chest, stomach and legs. This coat type provided protection from pests and harsh conditions.",Affenpinscher,"The Affenpinscher lives up to its name monkey terrier in both looks and actions. They are terriers at heart, busy, inquisitive, bold, and stubborn, but also love to monkey around, being playful and mischievous. This breed tends to bark and even climb. Unlike most terriers, they are fairly good with other dogs and pets. This little dog is best with a family that likes entertainment and has a very good sense of humor.","The Affenpinscher’s name describes it well: Affen meaning monkey and Pinscher meaning terrier. In France the Affenpinscher is known as the “diablotin moustachu”—moustached little devil, which also aptly describes it! As one of the oldest toy breeds, the Affenpinscher’s origins are obscure. Paintings by the old Dutch Masters from the fifteenth century often included dogs resembling Affenpinschers, but more definite evidence of the breed is absent. Small terriers adept at dispatching rats were abundant in central Europe by the seventeenth century. In Germany, they were used to rid stables and kitchens of rodents. Even smaller versions of these dogs were preferred for lady’s lap dogs, able to protect the home from rodents, warm their mistress’ lap, and amuse the entire household with their antics. This small version eventually became the Affenpinscher, which was later refined by occasional crosses with the Pug, German Pinscher, and German Silky Pinscher. The Affenpinscher in turn became the progenitor of other wire-coated toys, most notably the Brussels Griffon. The breed was most popular in Germany, which can lay claim as its homeland. In 1936 the AKC recognized the Affenpinscher, but World War II slowed any momentum in popularity the breed had gained. Since then, the breed has remained extremely rare even in America and Germany, its comparative strongholds.","Major concerns: none

2,"The Afghan is built along greyhound-like lines, enabling this dog to execute a double-suspension gallop and run down fleet game. The comparatively short back and steep pelvis helped the Afghan to leap great heights and to turn almost in place, essential attributes for coursing in rocky mountainous terrain. The large feet provided better foothold and were more resistant to injury on rough ground. The silky coat protected the dog from cold nights at high altitudes. The Afghan appears dignified and aloof, with an exotic expression and proud carriage. The gait shows great elasticity and spring, and the dog moves with head and tail high.",Afghan Hound,"Despite the glamorous reputation, the Afghan Hound's heart lies in chasing down game over rugged terrain. While these dogs maintain regal bearings inside, Afghans need a daily chance to stretch their legs in a safe area. At times, they may have a reluctance to come when called. They will chase small animals outside, and will coexist peacefully inside. Though they can be gentle with children, the Afghan may not always be playful and interactive enough with them. Described by some as “catlike,” this breed is independent yet sensitive, and not overly demonstrative. They are reserved with strangers; some can be timid. They have a happy, clownish side.","With roots dating to the Egyptian pharaohs, the Afghan Hound is an ancient breed derived from the group of Middle Eastern sighthounds. Despite such illustrious roots, most of the Afghan Hound’s development is the result of their use by nomadic tribes as coursing hounds capable of providing small animal meat for the pot. The dogs often hunted with the aid of falcons, which were trained to swoop at the quarry. Generations of hunting in the harsh mountainous terrain of Afghanistan produced a fast dog that also had a good deal of stamina, but most of all, had incredible leaping ability and nimbleness. The Afghan's long coat provided protection from the cold climate. These dogs remained isolated for centuries, hidden in the impenetrable Afghanistan Mountains. The first Afghan Hound came to England in the early 1900s; at that time these dogs were called Persian Greyhounds or Barukhzy Hounds. They were a diverse lot so a standard of perfection—modeled on Zardin, a particularly striking dog—that described the more elegant, racy dog of today was created. Popularity grew slowly, with the dog appealing mostly to the glamour set. Popularity in the show ring was faster coming, with the Afghan quickly becoming one of the most competitive and glamorous dogs in the rings. In the 1970s the Afghan became a fad breed with the public, but has since dwindled in popularity.","Major concerns: none

3,"The Airedale Terrier is a neat, upstanding, long-legged terrier, not exaggerated in any way. This breed has strong round bone and combines strength and agility. The Airedale has strong jaws and a free gait. The coat is hard, dense, and wiry; it lies straight and close, with some hair crinkling or waving",Airedale Terrier,"Among the most versatile of terriers, the Airedale is bold, playful, and adventurous and is a lively yet protective companion. This breed is intelligent, but often stubborn and headstrong. Some can be domineering, but most are biddable, reliable, and responsive to their family's wishes. Airedales make good family pets as long as they get daily mental and physical exercise. They like to be the head dog and may not do well when another dog challenges that position, although usually get along well with smaller dogs.","Known as the King of Terriers, the Airedale is the tallest terrier. Like many terriers, this breed counts the old English, or Black and Tan, Terrier as one of its primary progenitors. These medium-sized dogs were prized by Yorkshire hunters (and poachers) for hunting a variety of game from water rat to fox. The dogs could also find and retrieve birds. Around the mid 1800s, some of these terriers around the River Aire in South Yorkshire were crossed with Otterhounds in order to improve their hunting ability around water, as well as their scenting ability. The result was a dog adept at otter hunting, originally called the Bingley or Waterside Terrier but recognized as the Airedale Terrier in 1878. Crosses to the Irish and Bull Terriers were made in order to reduce some of the remnants of the Otterhound cross that were now considered less than beautiful. By 1900, the patriarch of the breed, Champion Master Briar, was gaining renown, and his offspring carried on his influence in America. The Airedale’s size and gameness continued to win worldwide fame. This dog's smart looks and manners won it a place as a police dog and family pet, both roles it still enjoys. After World War I, however, The Airedale's popularity declined, and today this dog's reputation is greater than its numbers.","Major concerns: CHD

4," A unique combination of Mastiff and gazehound features, the Akbash Dog’s characteristics enable him to perform as a livestock guardian. This all-white, lean, leggy, muscular dog has an alert, regal appearance conveying power, strength and courage with the speed and agility necessary to challenge and chase predators. His wedge-shaped head is adorned with pendant ears and long tail is curled over his back when moving or excited. Like other gazehounds, the Akbash Dog is characterized by his long legs, deep chest and tucked flank; the breed’s Mastiff influence is found in his height, weight, broad head and powerful appearance.",Akbash,"Suitable as both a home companion and guard dog, the Akbash Dog is calm, quiet, independent and steady. He is loyal, gentle and affectionate with his human family, children and other pets. He is naturally alert and suspicious toward strangers and can be territorial toward other dogs. The Akbash Dog is receptive to training and should be properly and frequently socialized and trained from an early age to ensure a well-behaved family dog and guardian.","The Akbash Dog is an ancient breed native to western Turkey’s plains and mountains, where he was bred by villagers and shepherds to guard livestock from wolves and other predators. Although the Akbash Dog is the Turkish counterpart to other white guardian breeds native to the northern Mediterranean Basin, he is the only breed to have the distinct combination of Mastiff and gazehound characteristics. In the 1970s, Americans David and Judy Nelson began studying these dogs, importing more than 40 Akbash Dogs to the United States. These imported dogs became the breed’s foundation stock in both the United States and Canada. In 1980, the US Department of Agriculture included Akbash Dogs in the Predator Control Program, in which they successfully performed, and in 1998, the United Kennel Club officially recognized the Akbash Dog as a member of its Guardian Dog Group.","Major Concerns: N/A

5,"This is a large and powerful breed, with much substance and heavy bone, and is slightly longer than tall. The Akita’s build reflects its original job of finding big game in deep snow and rugged terrain. This breed’s double coat consists of a dense undercoat and straight, rough, outer coat standing off from the body, about 2 inches or less in length. Such a combination provides ample insulation from water and weather. The gait is brisk and powerful. The Akita is a versatile dog of large spitz type, able to perform as hiking companion and protector.",Akita,"As befitting its spitz-like heritage, the Akita is bold, independent, stubborn, and tenacious. Demonstrative to their family, they are utterly devoted and will protect family members. This dog is reserved with strangers and can be assertive, so should be introduced carefully to new dogs and household pets. They can be domineering. Though not the breed for everyone, in the right hands the Akita is an excellent companion.","The Akita is perhaps the most renowned and venerated of the native Japanese breeds. Although it bears a likeness to dogs from ancient Japanese tombs, the modern Akita is the result of a concerted nineteenth century effort to restore seven native Japanese dog breeds. The Akita, largest of these breeds, was restored using many breeds, including indigenous Odate dogs, which were used as the best representatives of native Japanese animals. Over time, Japanese breeders selected against many traits descended from some ancestors, including black mask, pinto pattern, and substantial size; whereas American breeders perpetuated those traits. In 1918, the Akita-inu Hozankai Society of Japan was formed to preserve the original Akita, and in 1931 the Akita was designated as one of Japan’s natural monuments. The most honored Akita of all time was Hachiko, who greeted his master every evening at the train station to accompany him home. When his master died at work one day, Haichiko waited for him, and continued to return and wait for his master every day until he died nine years later on March 8, 1935. Today, a statue and annual ceremony pay homage to Haichiko’s loyalty. The first Akita arrived in America in 1937, when Helen Keller returned from Japan with one. Following World War II, servicemen returned home with Akitas from Japan. The breed’s popularity grew slowly until it received AKC recognition in 1972. Since then, it has steadily gained admirers and continues to grow in popularity. The Akita is now used as a guard and police dog in Japan.","Major concerns: CHD, PRA

6,"The Alaskan Malamute is a powerfully built dog of Nordic breed type, developed to haul heavy loads rather than race. This breed is slightly longer than tall, and is heavy boned and compact, designed for strength and endurance. The Malamute’s gait is steady, balanced, and tireless. The coat is thick and double, with a coarse outer coat and dense, wooly, oily undercoat, providing the ultimate in insulation. Although the eyes have a “wolf-like” appearance, the expression is soft.",Alaskan Malamute,"The Alaskan Malamute is powerful, independent, strong willed, and fun loving. Given the dog’s history as a sled dog, the malamute loves activity and interaction with the family. Malamutes are family oriented, and as long as they are given daily exercise, they are well-mannered in the home. Without proper exercise, they can become frustrated and destructive. This dog is friendly and sociable toward people, but may be assertive and should be introduced carefully to new dogs, pets, or livestock. Some can be domineering, and tend to dig and howl.","Like most of the dogs of the spitz family, the Alaskan Malamute evolved in the Arctic regions, shaped by the adverse climatic conditions. The breed’s origin is unknown, but was first described living among the native Inuit people known as the Mahlemuts, who lived along Norton Sound on Alaska’s northwest coast. The word Mahlemut comes from Mahle, an Inuit tribe name, and mut, meaning village. The dogs served as hunting partners for big game, and hauled the heavy loads back home. These dogs were, of necessity, large and strong rather than fast, enabling one dog to do the work of many smaller dogs. They were an essential cog in these people’s lives and were treated almost as one of the family, although they were never pampered as pets. When the first outside explorers came to the region in the 1700s, they were impressed not only by the hardy dog but also by their owners’ obvious attachment to them.

With the discovery of gold in 1896, a flood of outsiders came to Alaska; for entertainment, they staged weight-pulling contests and races among their dogs. The native breeds were interbred with each other and those brought by settlers, often in an attempt to create a faster racer or simply supply the vast numbers of dogs needed to supply the gold rush. The pure Malamute was in danger of being lost.

In the 1920s, a New England dog racing enthusiast obtained some good specimens, and began to breed the traditional Malamutes. As the breed’s reputation grew, some were chosen to help Admiral Byrd in his 1933 trek to the South Pole. During World War II, the Malamute was once again called into service, this time to serve as freight haulers, pack animals, and search-and-rescue dogs. In 1935, the breed received AKC recognition and began a new phase as an imposing show dog and loyal pet.","Major concerns: CHD, cataract

7,"The Eskie is built along classic Nordic Spitz lines. This breed is compactly built, slightly longer than tall. The stand-off, double coat resists soaking and provides insulation against the cold. The small thick ears are also cold resistant, and the trot is agile and bold. The expression is keen and alert.",American Eskimo,"The American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively, and fun loving—in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion. True to this dog’s spitz heritage, The Eskie is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. They are among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and are calm and well-mannered inside. Because of their watchdog origins, Eskies can be wary of strangers, and may not be the best choice for homes with small children, other dogs, or pets unless well supervised.","As the prototypical spitz, the Eskie (as this breed is often called) is just as often simply called spitz by pet households. In fact, the American Eskimo Dog descended from one of the varieties of spitz developed in Germany, with influences from other spitz breeds such as the Keeshond, Pomeranian, and Volpino Italiano. Ironically, it was the success of these other breeds that held the Eskie back. Although the Keeshond originally came in several colors, when it was decided to accept only gray specimens, the white Keeshonden were suddenly excluded. When the Pomeranian standard was drawn up to exclude dogs over 8 pounds, larger dogs were excluded as Pomeranians. Thus, by the early 1900s, there were two groups of medium-sized white dogs that, although pure-breds, were excluded from their breeds. Their fate is unknown, but it is likely that they became pets of the working people.

When European workers came to America, they brought these dogs with them as general farm workers and watchdogs. The UKC began registering them in 1913. In the 1920s the American Spitz (as it had come to be called) became a favorite of circus performers. Spectators often left the circus with a new family member—an offspring of one of the dazzling performers. Many present-day Eskies can be traced back to their circus ancestors.

After World War I, the breed’s name was changed to American Eskimos, to remove any Germanic sound from the name. Most Eskies were kept as pets and farm dogs. It wasn’t until 1994 that the AKC recognized the breed. The Eskie remains a dog of the people, and a very popular companion.","Major concerns: none

The coat is silky, flat or slightly wavy, not overly long. Excessive coat can hinder the dog in the field. The head and expression are hallmarks of the breed; the expression is soft and appealing. The Cocker should still be able to spend a day in the field and should be balanced and athletic. It is true, however, that most Cockers now have too much coat for field work.",American Cocker Spaniel,"This breed is known as the “merry” Cocker, and the name is most fitting. He is playful, cheerful, amiable, sweet, sensitive, willing to please, and responsive to his family’s wishes. He is not known for retaining his hunting instincts, but he is inquisitive and will appreciate a country outing. He is equally at home in the city and will happily walk on leash for his exercise needs. Some bark a lot; some are overly submissive.","The American version of the Cocker Spaniel is derived from the English Cocker Spaniel. In the late 1800s, many English Cockers were brought to America, but American hunters preferred a slightly smaller dog to hunt quail and other small game birds. The American Cocker is smaller, with a rounder head, shorter muzzle, and more profuse coat than its English ancestor. Just how this smaller Cocker was developed is not entirely clear; some credit the dog Obo 2nd, born around 1880, as the first true American Cocker. But other evidence points to crosses of the English Cocker with even smaller toy spaniels (that nonetheless arose from the same ancestral stock).

Initially the English and American Cocker Spaniels were considered varieties of the same breed, but they were officially separated by the AKC in 1935. Although Cockers were already popular, after the separation the American Cocker surged in popularity and has remained one of the most popular breeds of all time in America. In fact, it was the most popular breed for many years. So popular was it that it was eventually divided into three color varieties: black, particolor, and ASCOB, which stands for Any Solid Color Other than Black. Only recently has its popularity spread to England, where it was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1968, and it has gained admirers steadily since.","Major concerns: cataract, glaucoma, PRA

He is a gentle, affectionate and loving companion, albeit fearless and ready to strike should any intruder cross his path. An energetic, active working dog, the American Bulldog exudes a dominant, powerful and athletic appearance, with strong muscles and substantial boning. He gets along well with young children, as well as dogs and other pets so long as he was raised with them from the start. The American Bulldog does not do well when left alone for prolonged periods of time. With proper socialization, training and regular exercise, the American Bulldog is a true companion and excellent watchdog.","Originating in England, the general bulldog type began as a working dog that drove cattle and guarded his master’s property. Known for his strength, courage and ease around livestock, the breed began being used for bull baiting before it was outlawed in England. Consequently following the ban, the breed was replaced with the less athletic, shorter and stockier English Bulldog.

Meanwhile, the original bulldog type was preserved by working class immigrants, who brought them on their journey to America to use as all-around working dogs on farms and ranches in the South. The breed nearly became extinct after World War II, but a returning war veteran named John D. Johnson worked to revive the breed alongside Alan Scott and other breeders. From here came the Johnson and Scott types — the former being the “standard” (a sleek, athletic dog built for performance) and the latter being referred to as the “bully” (a bulkier, heavier dog with more muscle mass). Despite these differences, Johnson and Scott maintained the breed’s overall health and working abilities. Today, the modern American Bulldog as we know it remains a well-rounded working dog, courageous guard dog and faithful family companion. The United Kennel Club recognized the American Bulldog in 1999.","Major Concerns: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (a disorder of the nervous system that causes swelling and changes in the retinal cells) and kidney and/or thyroid disorders

For all of their tough persona, the most important thing in life to this breed is their family’s fond attention.","The American Staffordshire Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier descended from the same lines. The fist dog originally sprang from mixing the old type of Bulldog with some old terrier types, probably the English Smooth Terrier. The result was aptly called the Bull and Terrier, later to be dubbed the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. They gained passage to America in the late 1800s, where they became known as the Pit Bull Terrier, American Bull Terrier, and even Yankee Terrier. Americans favored a slightly bigger dog than the English preferred, and with time the two strains diverged.

In 1936, the AKC recognized the breed as the Staffordshire Terrier (the name was changed in 1972 to American Staffordshire Terrier). The Am Staff evolved to have a sweet and trustworthy disposition around people. Unfortunately, these dogs have sometimes appealed to people seeking them for their strength rather than their loving abilities. Beginning in the 1980s, Am Staffs sometimes found themselves the target of breed-specific laws aimed at banning or controlling certain types of dogs. Despite this, the Am Staff is extremely popular among people wanting a people- and fun-loving dog.","Major concerns: CHD, cerebellar ataxia, PRA

They are suspicious of strangers and are territorial. While good with children, they may not be playful enough to satisfy children’s desires. As a serious watch dog, this dog tends to bark a lot when his suspicions are aroused.","The Anatolian Shepherd is an ancient guardian breed with a long working history. This dog’s roots probably lie in the Tibetan Mastiff and Roman Mollosian war dogs that came to Turkey more than 4,000 years ago. Here they proved invaluable as staunch defenders of livestock against formidable predators, including wolves and bears. They accompanied the nomadic shepherds and became widespread over a large geographical region, accounting for the Anatolian’s great variation in size, coat type, and color. Several traits that remained constant throughout all the breed, however, are loyalty, independence, and hardiness.

The name Shepherd is a misnomer because the breed was never used as a herder. This breed’s Turkish name, koban kopegi, means shepherd’s dog. There is disagreement over whether the Anatolian is a separate breed from the Kangal (or Karabash) dog.

The first of the breed did not come to America until the 1950s, where although they proved themselves as effective livestock guards against coyotes and other predators, they remained relatively unknown. Only in the late 1970s and 1980s did the Anatolian Shepherd begin to be more widely appreciated, still valued for its utilitarian, rather than cosmetic, attributes. Pet owners desiring a loyal and effective guardian began to acquire the breed. In 1996, the Anatolian Shepherd was accepted in the AKC Working Group, and they continue to have strong working instincts above all else.

The weather-resistant coat consists of a short, dense undercoat and moderately short, straight outer coat of medium texture.",Australian Cattle Dogs,"Smart, hardy, independent, stubborn, tenacious, energetic, and untiring— these are all traits essential to a driver of headstrong cattle, and all traits of the Australian Cattle Dog. Given challenging mental and hard physical exercise daily, this breed is among the most responsive and obedient of dogs. The Cattle Dog tends to nip at heels of running children, but is good with older children.","In the early 1800s, vast land areas in Australia became available for grazing cattle. The cattle raised on these lands became so wild and intractable that the traditional European herding breeds that had proved satisfactory on tamer cattle were no longer suited for the job. A dog was needed that could withstand traveling long distances over rough terrain in hot weather and that could control cattle without barking (which only served to make wild cattle wilder).

In 1840, a man named Hall bred some smooth blue merle Highland Collies to Dingos, producing a strain known as Hall’s Heelers. One particularly influential dog was named Bentley’s Dog, and is credited with originating the white blaze found on the head of Australian Cattle Dogs today. Other breeders crossed their Hall’s Heelers with other breeds, including the Bull Terrier, Dalmatian, and, later, Black and Tan Kelpie, a sheepherding breed. The result was a dog with the herding instincts of the Collie and Kelpie, the endurance, ruggedness, and quiet style of the Dingo, and the horse sense and protectiveness of the Dalmatian, all with a distinctively patterned coat.

As the dogs became increasingly vital to the cattle industry of Queensland, they gained the name Queensland Blue Heeler. They later became known as Australian Heeler, and then Australian Cattle Dog. A standard for the breed, emphasizing the Dingo characteristics, was drawn up in 1897. The Australian Cattle Dog was slow to catch on in America, however, perhaps because the breed bore little resemblance to established herding breeds. When given a chance, they proved their merits and were welcomed as herders and pets. The AKC recognized the breed in 1980.","Major concerns: CHD, OCD, deafness, PRA, elbow dysplasia

The expression is keen, intelligent, and eager.",Australian Shepherd,"The Australian Shepherd has a great deal of stamina and is loving, bold, alert, confident, independent, smart, and responsive. If they don’t get a chance to exercise and challenge their strongly developed mental and physical activities, they are apt to become frustrated and difficult to live with. With proper exercise and training, this dog is a loyal, utterly devoted, and obedient companion. The Aussie is reserved with strangers, and has a protective nature. This breed may try to herd children and small animals by nipping.","The Australian Shepherd is not really an Australian breed, but came to America by way of Australia. One popular theory of the breed’s origin begins during the 1800s when the Basque people of Europe settled in Australia, bringing with them their sheep and sheepdogs. Shortly thereafter, many of these shepherds relocated to the western United States, with their dogs and sheep. American shepherds naturally dubbed these dogs Australian Shepherds because that was their immediate past residence.

The rugged area of Australia and western America placed demands on the herding dogs that they had not faced in Europe, but through various crosses and rigorous selection for working ability, the Basque dog soon adapted and excelled under these harsh conditions. The breed kept a low profile until the 1950s, when they were featured in a popular trick-dog act that performed in rodeos and was featured in film. Many of these dogs, owned by Jay Sisler, can be found in the pedigrees of today’s Aussies.

The first Aussie was registered with the International English Shepherd Registry, now known as the National Stock Dog Registry. The AKC recognized the Australian Shepherd in 1993. Its popularity according to AKC statistics underestimates the popularity of this breed because a large proportion of this working breed remains unregistered with the AKC. This dog is among the most versatile of breeds, excelling at conformation, obedience, herding, and agility competition. The Aussie is also adept at working cattle; in fact, some believe its close working style is more suited to cattle than to sheep.","Major concerns: cataract, CEA

14,"The Australian Terrier is small, sturdy, and medium boned; this breed is long in proportion to height. This is a working terrier that should exhibit a ground-covering gait and hard condition. This dog’s weatherproof coat is made up of a short, soft undercoat and a harsh, straight, outer coat, about 2.5 inches long, shorter on the tail and lower legs. They sport a ruff around the neck and a topknot of longer hair adds to their keen, intelligent expression.",Australian Terrier,"One of the quieter terriers, the Aussie is nonetheless a plucky, tough character, ready to go after a rodent when the chance arises. This dog is fun loving and adventurous, and needs daily exercise to keep from becoming frustrated. Aussies are clever and generally eager to please, making them one of the more obedient terriers. They get along fairly well with other dogs and household pets. They are reserved with strangers. Reflecting their earth dog heritage, they like to dig.","The national terrier of Australia, this is one of the smallest of the working terriers. This breed was born in Tasmania, from various European breeds, and shares much of its background with the Silky Terrier. In Tasmania, the Rough Coated Terrier was an all-purpose companion, protecting the home and farm from rodents, controlling livestock, and sounding the alarm at intruders. A cornucopia of breeds was crossed with this dog, among them the precursors of the Skye, Dandie Dinmont, Scotch, Yorkshire, and Manchester Terriers. The result was a dog that was both useful and striking in appearance.

The first of the breed was shown in the late 1800s as a “broken-coated terrier of blackish blue sheen.” The name was soon changed to the Blue and Tan, the Toy, then the Blue Terrier, then in 1900 the Rough-Coated Terrier, Blue and Tan. Although mainly known for its blue and tan coloration, a red or sandy color was also found among the early representatives of the breed. Soon after the breed had made its way to British show rings and homes, and by 1925 it had come to America. The Australian Terrier received AKC recognition in 1960.","Major concerns: none

15,"The Basset’s long, heavy body and short legs make this breed easy to follow on foot, and give it an edge in dense cover. The Basset Hound has heavier bone, in proportion to total size, than any other breed. This dog’s thick, tight coat protects from brambles without becoming caught in them. It is speculated that the long ears may stir up ground scent, and the wrinkles trap the scent around the face. The large muzzle gives ample room for the olfactory apparatus. Such room would not be available in a miniature dog; only a large dog with shortened legs can combine the short height with large muzzle size. The Basset’s movement is smooth and powerful; they tend to move with nose to the ground.",Basset Hound,"The Basset Hound is among the most good natured and easygoing of breeds. This breed is amiable with dogs, other pets, and children, although children must be cautioned not to put strain on this and all dogs’ backs with their games. The Basset is calm inside, but needs regular exercise in order to keep fit. They prefer to investigate slowly, and love to sniff and trail. These are talented and determined trackers, not easily dissuaded from their course. Because of this, they may get on a trail and follow it until becoming lost. This dog tends to be stubborn and slow moving. Bassets have a loud bay that they use when excited on the trail.","The first mention of the “Basset” dog is found in a sixteenth-century text about badger hunting. Dwarfed short-legged specimens occur in many breeds and have been known since ancient times, but it is difficult to know at what point such dogs were purposefully bred and which ones led to the present Basset Hound. There is, in fact, evidence that dwarfed hounds existed alongside full-sized hounds as long ago as the fifth century a.d. in France.

The word Basset is derived from the French bas meaning low thing or dwarf, so that definitive evidence of the breed may be hard to follow. Short-legged dogs were used by the pre-Revolutionary French for hunting at a slower pace, but most of these dogs were dispersed, and their fates undocumented, during the French Revolution. The history becomes clearer after the Revolution, when greater numbers of commoners took up hunting, often aided by guns. They needed a dog that they could follow on foot, but that still had great scenting ability and strong heavy bone—in essence, a short-legged version of the pack hounds popular with the aristocracy. Because the Basset could not pursue quarry at speed, the quarry was less likely to be on the run and thus presented an easier target for the gunman. The dogs would hunt all mammals but were especially suited for rabbits and hares.

Four different versions of short-legged hounds were created, with the Basset Artesien Normand most closely resembling today’s Basset. In the late 1800s (and again in 1930), crosses with Bloodhounds were made to increase size; the results were then tempered with subsequent crosses to the Artesien Normand.

The first Bassets were brought to England and America in the late 1800s, and interest in the breed grew gradually. In 1885, the Basset Hound became one of the first breeds to be AKC recognized. By the mid 1900s, the Basset’s droll expression had won a place in advertising and entertainment and in many new pet owner’s hearts.","Major concerns: OCD, elbow dysplasia, thrombopathy, entropion, ectropion, otitis externa, glaucoma, gastric torsion, CHD

Beagles can also be carried, and they can scurry around in thick underbrush. Their close hard coat protects them from underbrush. Their moderate build enables them to nimbly traverse rough terrain. The Beagle’s amiable personality allows this breed to get along with other dogs and to be a wonderful pet. Beagles are noted for their melodious bay. The deep muzzle allows more room for olfactory receptors, aiding the Beagle’s uncanny sense of smell.",Beagle,"One of the most amiable hounds, the Beagle was originally bred to be part of a pack and needs companionship, whether human or canine. This dog loves to explore the outdoors and is an enthusiastic trailer. Given adequate exercise, the Beagle is a calm, tractable house pet. Beagles tend to be excellent with children, gentle, incredibly tolerant, and always ready to join in a game or adventure. This is an independent breed, however, and may run off if a trail beckons. Beagles bark and howl.","By the fourteenth century, hare-hunting had become a popular sport in England, and the dogs used were probably of Beagle type. The origin of the name Beagle may be from old French words meaning open throat in reference to the breed’s melodious bay, or from the Celtic, old English, or old French words for small. The word Beagle was not used until 1475, however, but can then be found frequently in writings from the sixteenth century on.

Hunters could follow these dogs on foot and could even carry one in a pocket if the need arose. By the 1800s, Beagles existed in several sizes, but the smaller “pocket-size” dogs were particularly popular. These dogs measured only about 9 inches and often needed the hunter’s assistance in crossing rough fields. One of the special appeals of the smaller Beagles was that the hunt could be followed even by “ladies, the aged, or the infirm,” as they slowly followed the winding path of the hare.

The first mention of the Beagle in America was in 1642. Beagles were used in the South prior to the Civil War, but these dogs bore little resemblance to their English counterparts. After the war, English imports formed the basis of the modern American Beagle. By the end of the nineteenth century, Beagles were popular competitors in both field and conformation exhibitions. But the merry little scenthound did not stop there: the Beagle continued to become one of America’s all-time favorite breeds, finding a special niche as family pet.","Major concerns: intervertebral disk disease, CHD

A wolf in lamb’s clothing, the Bedlington is unrivaled in ability to chase and engage agile but tough quarry. The gait is light and springy. The coat is a mixture of hard and soft hair standing off the skin, affording good protection as well as outstanding appearance.",Bedlington Terrier,"The Bedlington is among the softer terriers, not only in looks and feel but in temperament. This breed is companionable, demonstrative, and loyal. They enjoy creature comforts and are fairly quiet. Even though they will seldom initiate a fight, Bedlingtons will not allow themselves to be intimidated by other dogs and can be a scrappy fighter when pushed. They will give chase to small animals outdoors, but can usually coexist with them indoors.","One of the most unusual members of the terrier group is the Bedlington Terrier. This breed comes from England, hailing from the Hanny Hills of Northumberland. The exact origin is obscure, but in the late eighteenth century a strain of game terriers was developed that became known as Rothbury Terriers. In 1825, Joseph Ainsley of the town of Bedlington bred two of his Rothbury Terriers and christened their offspring a Bedlington Terrier. Occasional crosses to other breeds arguably included the Whippet (for speed) and Dandie Dinmont Terrier (for coat), but no documented evidence of such crosses exist, and some breed historians assert that such crosses were never made. Whatever the process, the result was an agile, effective game terrier.

By the late 1800s, the breed had stepped into the show ring as well as into the homes of the more elite. At one time the liver color was more popular, although the blue has since passed it in popularity. The Bedlington’s lamb-like appearance draws many admirers, but the emphasis on trimming eventually dampened the breed’s popularity as a show dog. With more easily available grooming tools and instructions, the Bedlington has regained much of its popularity with the public.","Major concerns: copper toxicosis

The Malinois has a tendency to run in a wide circle rather than a straight line. The coat is fairly short, straight, and hard, with a dense undercoat. The expression is intelligent and questioning.",Belgian Shepherd,"Intense best describes the Belgian Malinois. This is a high-energy breed with a need for regular mental and physical stimulation. These dogs are alert, smart, and serious. They can be aloof with strangers and should be introduced to other dogs and animals carefully. Some can be domineering. When confined, they often run in sweeping circles in an effort to stay on the move. They are protective of their home and family.","The Belgian sheepherding breeds, collectively known as Chiens de Berger Belge, shared their early history as general-purpose shepherds and guard dogs of Belgium. As working dogs, they were bred for ability rather than esthetics, and no careful records were kept. Thus, when dog shows became popular in the late 1800s, it was not clear if Belgium had any recognizable breeds with which they could tout their national pride.

In 1891, Professor Reul was asked to study the native dogs to see if they could be sorted into distinct breeds. He found a group of similar dogs that differed only in coat type and color, all of which were grouped as Belgian Shepherds. The short-haired variety was developed in the area around Malines, and so became known as the Belgian Malinois.

This breed remains the most popular of the Belgian shepherd breeds in its native land, but has had a rockier road in America. Between 1911 and World War II, the Malinois enjoyed a good deal of popularity in America. After the war, registrations plummeted, and it was rare to find a Malinois entered in competition. When the breeds were separated in 1959, Malinois registrations began to grow once again, but they still fell far behind the other Belgian breeds.

More recently, the Malinois is becoming popular because of its reputation as one of the preeminent police dogs in the world, surpassing even the German Shepherd in demand. Thus, even though these dogs may not be seen in many homes, they are making their presence known as keepers of the peace throughout the world.","Major concerns: none

The expression is gentle, and the color is striking.",Bernese Mountain Dog,"The Bernese Mountain Dog is an easygoing, calm family companion (that is, after the adolescent stage). This dog is sensitive, loyal, extremely devoted, gentle with children, and often reserved with strangers. The Bernese generally gets along well with other dogs and pets. They do not do well isolated from family activities.","The most well known of the Sennehunde, or Swiss mountain dogs, the Bernese is distinguished by being the only one to have a fairly long, silky coat. The origin of the breed is speculative at best. Some experts believe this breed’s history traces to the Roman invasion of Switzerland, when the Roman mastiffs were crossed with native flock-guarding dogs. This cross produced a strong dog that was able to withstand the Alpine weather and that could serve as draft dog, flock guard, drover, herder, and general farm dog.

Despite their utility, little attempt was made to perpetuate them as a breed purposefully. By the late 1800s, the breed was in danger of being lost. At that time, Professor Albert Heim initiated a study of Swiss dogs that led to the identification of the Bernese Mountain Dog as one of the existing types. These dogs were found only in the valleys of the lower Alps. Through Dr. Heim’s efforts, these dogs were promoted throughout Switzerland and even Europe. The finest specimens came to be found in the Durrbach area, at one time giving the breed the name Durrbachler. With the breed’s spread, the name was changed to Bernese Mountain Dog.

They doesn’t like to be left alone, and can bark a lot. Bichons can be hard to housetrain.","The Bichon Frise has roots in the Mediterranean, originally produced by crossing the Barbet (a large water dog) with small coated, often white dogs. This cross eventually produced a family of dogs known as barbichons, which was later shortened to bichons. The bichons were divided into four types: the Maltaise, Bolognese, Havanese, and Tenerife. The Tenerife, considered to be one of the sources of the Bichon Frise, developed on the Canary Island of Tenerife, probably having been taken there by Spanish seafarers in ancient times. In the fourteenth century, Italian sailors brought these dogs back from the island to the Continent, where they quickly became favored pets of the upper class.

Following a series of French invasions of Italy in the 1500s, the little dogs (known there as Bolgnese) were adopted by the French. They were special pets of Francis I and his successor, Henry III. They also enjoyed popularity in Spain, but for some reason, the breed’s popularity waned throughout Europe. The Bichon experienced a brief resurgence during the reign of Napoleon III in the early nineteenth century, but once again quickly faded from favor. This began a new chapter in the Bichon’s history, as the breed sank from court favorite to common street dog. The Bichons survived, however, because of their propensity for performing tricks, and they teamed with peddlers and organ grinders to entertain passersby for money.

With the advent of World War I, the little dogs were nearly lost. A few dogs were brought back home by soldiers, but no real effort to save the Bichon was made until a few French breeders began an earnest effort to establish the breed. In 1933, the FCI adopted a breed standard and officially named it the Bichon Frise. The breed was threatened again, this time by World War II. It was not until it came to America in the 1950s that its future became secure. Even then, the breed did not catch on until recommended grooming was updated and it received greater publicity in the 1960s.

Although not the easiest breed to train for traditional obedience, Bloodhounds are exceptionally easy to train in tasks involving trailing. The Bloodhound is reserved with strangers.","The quintessential scenthound, the Bloodhound’s roots trace back to ancient times. Their earliest ancestor may have been the black St. Huberts hound documented in Europe by the eighth century. William the Conqueror is credited with bringing these hounds to England in 1066. In the twelfth century, many Church dignitaries were interested in hunting with these dogs, and most monasteries kept carefully bred packs. So highly bred were these dogs that they came to be known as “blooded hounds,” referring to their pure blood and noble breeding.

Bloodhounds have been known in America since the mid 1800s. The Bloodhound has since proved itself to be one of the most useful of breeds, using its unrivaled sense of smell to trail lost persons and criminals alike. After the person is located, the Bloodhound’s job is over because they are never inclined to attack.

The Bloodhound holds many trailing records (for both length and age of trail), and at one time was the only breed of dog whose identifications were accepted in a court of law. Ironically, the Bloodhound’s name and bad press scared many people away from the breed because they believed stories that claimed the dogs trailed people out of a lust for blood. Nothing, of course, could be farther from the truth.

The Abyssinian is often a colorful cat with a distinctly ticked coat, medium in size and regal in appearance; lithe, hard and muscular, showing eager activity and lively interest in their surroundings. They are often well balanced temperamentally and physically.",Abyssinian,"Abyssinians aren't for those who want a cat that enjoys being picked up and cuddled. Because they can often be courageous, curious, and high-spirited, when they feel restrained Abyssinians tend to attempt to struggle free.

That's not to say Abyssinians are aloof or standoffish; they're typically affectionate, devoted, and loving companions. While typically not lap cats, they may prefer to sit next to you rather than on you. Nevertheless, they'll follow you from room to room to keep an eye on what you're doing.

While Abyssinians will cheerfully entertain themselves, they are most happy when they're very involved member of the household. They are particularly involved at dinnertime. Abyssinians regularly perform antics for your-and their-amusement, earning them the reputation of the clowns of the cat kingdom. They may perch on shoulders, crawl under covers, and sit beside you purring madly before racing off to bat imaginary butterflies and make flying leaps at the tallest bookcases.

Natural athletes, no closed room or cupboard is safe from their agile paws and inquiring minds. Vocally they tend to be quiet. They purr with great enthusiasm, however, particularly around dinner time. If you'll be away all day, you may want to consider providing a cat companion to keep your Abyssinians entertained or she will become bored and may act out.  If you work all day and have an active social life at night, an Abyssinian may not be the cat for you.","The Abyssinian is unquestionably one of the oldest known breeds, but no one knows exactly when or where they originated. Some think the Abyssinians's ancestors came from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), and that they were named for that country. Others think the breed originated on the coast of the Indian Ocean and in parts of Southeast Asia; recent genetic studies indicate today's Abyssinian may have descended from a type of cat found in those areas.

The best known tale is that today's Abyssinians is a descendant of the sacred cats worshiped as the physical manifestations of the gods in the temples and palaces of the ancient Egyptians some 4,000 to 6,000 years ago. Abyssinians do look like the cats depicted in Egyptian murals and sculptures, but so does the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), the species known to have been mummified by the ancient Egyptians and from which feline experts believe all domestic cats arose. Abyssinians are often known for their lively temperaments.

A cat named Zula was transported from Abyssinia to England at the end of the Abyssinian War in 1868, but whether Zula was an Abyssinian is subject to debate. The illustration of Zula shows a cat with very small ears and a head type unlike a typical Abyssinian. Since there's no written evidence linking Zula with today's breed, some maintain that the original lines died out, and the Abyssinian was recreated by the British from existing British Bunny cats that have Abyssinian-like ticking.

Without question, the breed was promoted and refined by the British until World War II decimated the breed, forcing the British to start over from scratch. Two Abyssinians arrived in America from England in the early 1900s. However, the Abyssinians who began  today's North American breed were imported from Britain in the 1930s. Since then. the breed has gained popularity for their beauty and acrobatic antics. Today, the Abyssinian one of the most popular shorthairs.","Body:

A couple found Yodie while they were vacationing at the motel. Yodie's parents and ancestry were unknown, but rumor had it he was a bobcat/domestic cat hybrid because of his feral appearance and short, bobcat-like tail. While it's possible for domestic cats to reproduce with bobcats (Felis rufus, an indigenous North American spotted cat closely related to the lynx), such hybrids, particularly the first generation males, would almost certainly be sterile. It's more likely that Yodie's short tail occurred as a spontaneous mutation within the domestic cat population.

Charmed by Yodie's friendly personality and short stub of a tail, the couple took him home with them. Once home, Yodie impregnated the family's sealpoint Siamese (proving himself fertile and not half bobcat). This first litter contained some normal-tailed and some bobtailed kittens, suggesting the gene governing Yodie's bobbed tail was dominant, since their Siamese had no history of short-tailed ancestors. Only one copy of a dominant gene was needed for the trait to appear in offspring. They chose the name American Bobtail for the breed.

The original lines from Yodie and his descendants became inbred and unhealthy. The focus then became to make the breed more healthy and one that looked like Yodie: a large, feral-looking tabby with long hair and a bobbed tail. The healthier cats had a rounded brow from forehead to eye ridge, giving them the ""hunting gaze"" that enhances their feral look. The American Bobtail has been accepted by four North American associations. The new and improved American Bobtail comes in all colors, categories, and have a sweet deposition but the feral look of the bobcat. They have both long and short coats.","Body:

26,"The American Shorthair is a true breed of working cat. The general effect is that of a strongly built, well balanced, symmetrical cat with conformation indicating power, endurance, and agility. ",American Shorthair,"When describing the American Shorthair, the expression “happy medium” springs to mind. These all-American cats are medium in size, build, type, and temperament; they are neither too big nor too small, not overly cuddly nor distant, neither couch potatoes nor hyperactive. The American Shorthair is the perfect breed for those who want a cat that enjoys being in your lap but not in your face. American Shorthairs are known for their adaptable temperaments and quiet voices; they are sociable, easily trained, and adapt well to other animals and children. They generally do not like to be picked up; like their Pilgrim companions who left England to find freedom, they cherish their independence. Because of the American Shorthair’s history as a working cat, they make great companions in terms of health, strength, and vitality. American Shorthairs enjoy a good romp with their favorite humans, but can amuse themselves with a ball of paper just as well. They tend to remain active and playful well into their old age. Due to their barn cat background, ASHs have strong hunting instincts and enjoy catching and killing catnip mice—and real ones, too, if given access to the great outdoors, something that’s discouraged by breeders. Your indoor ASH will put presents on your pillow, usually well-killed catnip mice, and proudly wait for the well-deserved petting and praise.","No one knows exactly when domestic cats first set paw in America. However, it’s clear that cats arrived with the Europeans settlers, since America has no indigenous cat species from which domestic cats could have developed. Since cats were often kept aboard ships to protect the grain and other foodstuffs from rodents, it’s not surprising that domestic cats first appeared in North America when the Europeans arrived; North America has no indigenous species from which domestic cats could have developed. Domestic cats may have been catting around the New World since the 1500s. Unquestionably, domestic cats were present in Jamestown, the first permanent British colony in the New World, since a written record dating from 1609 mentions the colony’s cats. On July 4, 1776, when the members of the Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia to adopt the Declaration of Independence, the American Shorthair’s ancestors were around to witness the historic event. They were too busy ridding the barns and fields of mice to put their paw print alongside Thomas Jefferson’s signature, but they heartily approved of the document. After all, cats declared their independence thousands of years ago and hold the concept dear to their hearts to this day. Cats became working members of American society, performing that age-old service as the perfect mouser. Function was far more important than form, and folks paid little attention to the color, pattern, and body style of their mousers. Through natural selection— since life in those days was hard on cat and human alike—these feline immigrants developed powerful muscles, strong jaws, and hardy, healthy constitutions. In time, life became easier, and cats became more than mere mouse-catchers as people began to take an interest in the beauty of the feline form. At first, American Shorthairs were welcomed in the newly formed American cat fancy in the late 1800s. At that time, the breed was merely called Shorthair. Later, the breed was renamed Domestic Shorthair. The first American Shorthair to be registered in this country was an orange tabby male named Belle that ironically was imported from England in the early 1900s. It wasn’t until 1904 when the first American-born American Shorthair (named Buster Brown) was registered under the breed name of Shorthair. With the import of foreign breeds, the familiarity of the ASH no longer worked in its favor. Early in the 1900s, fanciers became more interested in the imported breeds like the Persian and Angora than in the familiar ASH that had warmed their laps and served them faithfully for so many years. The foreign imports crossed with the ASH, and the pure bloodlines of the American native became diluted. In the early 1900s, a group of fanciers who loved the sturdy look of their proud all-American cats began a selective breeding program to preserve the natural beauty, mild temperament, and hardiness of the American Shorthair. However, acceptance in the show ring was a long time coming. As late as the 1960s American Shorthairs were still treated like the strays of the cat fancy. Breeders also battled confusion between their carefully bred American Shorthairs and random-bred domestic cats. While a non-pedigreed domestic cat may look something like a pedigreed American Shorthair, the mix of genes means that a random-bred domestic generally will not breed true; you cannot count on type, temperament, and length of hair as you can with a pedigreed American Shorthair. In the late 1950s a number of ASH breeders, hoping to “improve” the breed and introduce new colors, began crossbreeding Persians into their American Shorthair lines. As a result, the American Shorthair body style and head type began to change, becoming more Persian in style. The face broadened and flattened, the eyes became rounder, the ears shorter. However, many American Shorthair breeders, who had struggled for decades to promote the natural beauty of the ASH, were dismayed at the changes. The American Shorthair standard was subsequently amended to disqualify any cat showing evidence of hybridization. In September 1965, breeders voted to change the breed’s name to “American Shorthair.” With the brand-new name came a brand-new image, and the breed finally received some of the esteem it deserved. The same year, CFA named a silver tabby male (Shawnee Trademark) Best Cat, and the breed finally began to receive some hard-earned respect in the cat fancy. Today, the American Shorthair is one of the most popular shorthairs, a fitting status for America’s hometown breed.","Body:

27,"The American Wirehair cat resulted as a spontaneous mutation. Their coat, which is not only springy, dense, and resilient, but also coarse and hard to the touch, distinguishes the American Wirehair from all other breeds.",American Wirehair,"The American Wirehair’s hair may be abrasive and unruly, but their personality is anything but. American Wirehair are people cats that enjoy their family's attention and affection and are loyal and playful. They are active without being hyper, and affectionate without being clingy.

Similar in personality to the American Shorthair, American Wirehairs are mild-mannered, middle-of-the-road cats. Not demanding, they enjoy their family's attention but retain their independent spirit. Agile and fun-loving, they often enjoy playing fetch and are a bit more playful and active than the American Shorthair. They enjoy interactive toys in which their family takes an active role but they can also entertain themselves if necessary.

They generally get along well with other pets and children. Some have said that they seem particularly in tune with their person's feelings and try to offer comfort and companionship when their chosen humans are feeling blue. That’s when they turn on the purrs and sit beside them to offer their support.","Like the American Curl, the American Wirehair started as a spontaneous mutation in the domestic cat population; somewhere along the line, an unusual litter was produced with distinctive fur.

In 1966, Fluffy and Bootsie, two barn cats with no apparent unusual qualities from a small farm in upstate New York, parented a litter in which all five kittens had peculiar wiry hair. Sadly, only one kitten ultimately survived. This was particularly unfortunate since subsequent litters between Fluffy and Bootsie did not include any further wiry haired kittens. Whatever created that one unusual litter apparently was a one-time thing. However, the one surviving kitten— a red and white bicolor male—lived and prospered.

Joan O’Shea of nearby Vernon, New York heard about the surviving kitten from a friend, who told her the kitten looked just like her Rex cats. O’Shea drove up to look at the kitten and instantly fell in love with the long-legged, big-eared kitten with the twisted fur. She also realized that the kitten, named Adam, wasn’t a Rex at all but likely an entirely new breed. Adam eventually left his farm to become part of Joan's family. There, Adam produced litters with neighborhood cats, some of the kittens having Adam's wiry coat.

It was learned that the gene responsible for the wirehair coat was dominant; only one parent needed the gene to produce Wirehair offspring. To make sure the breed wasn’t related to one of the existing Rex breeds, samples of Adam’s hair were sent to noted British cat geneticists for analysis. The analyzed hair samples showed the coat was unique and not related to either the Cornish or Devon Rex.

Today, all American Wirehairs are descendants of Adam or one of his kittens, named Amy. This breed is still relatively rare, even though they are now recognized by the four largest North American cat associations.","Physical Attributes

The Balinese is often a svelte cat with long tapering lines, very lithe but strong and muscular. The Balinese is unique with their distinct range of colors and silky coat that hides a supple and athletic body.  ",Balinese,"Since the Balinese and the Siamese are closely related, they share many traits. Like the Siamese, Balinese are curious, outgoing, intelligent cats with excellent communication skills. They are known for their chatty personalities and are always eager to tell you their views on life, love, and what you’ve served them for dinner. They often keep up a running monologue; they are not for those who think cats should be seen and not heard.

Balinese are often in tune with your moods and will be right there to cheer you up if you’re sad or to share your joy when you’re happy. Vocal themselves, they may respond to your tone of voice, and a scolding tone may hurt their sensitive feelings. A coaching tone and positive reinforcement are the only effective way for correcting unwanted behavior.

Balinese are agile and athletic, and if allowed will hitch a ride on the shoulder of any willing member of the family. They love to play and easily learn to fetch, bringing the ball or toy back for repeated throwing. They keep you entertained with their antics, but have a loving, devoted disposition as well. They can be quite assertive in their requests for attention, but also possess a special dignity particular to the Balinese and Siamese breeds.","In the early 1900s, longhaired kittens began appearing spontaneously in otherwise shorthaired Siamese litters. Some believe the recessive gene for long hair was introduced into the European Siamese gene pool after World War I. Since the Siamese was nearly obliterated during the war, other breeds and some mixed-breed domestic cats were used to revitalize the breed. The Turkish Angora, a breed with a silky semi-long fur similar to the Balinese coat, was thought to have been one of the breeds used.

Others believe that the recessive gene for long hair is simply a naturally occurring mutation. Both hypotheses have been disputed, and both have their reputable proponents, but no one really knows for sure. Regardless of how the long hair gene was acquired, the occasional longhair kittens were quietly given away.

In the 1940s, some people eventually thought these cats might be a good addition to the existing cat breeds. These longhaired cats began to be promoted and known as the Balinese. The Balinese name was intended to compare the cat’s graceful movements and flowing lines to those of the colorful dancers of Bali. In those early days, Balinese cats often had heavier boning and thicker coats than the Siamese.

By 1970, all major North American associations that existed at that time had accepted the Balinese. After the Balinese's recognition, a color variant of this breed, the Javanese who was created by mixing the Balinese with the Colorpoint Shorthair, began to be promoted.  The Javanese combined the semi-long Balinese coat with the Colorpoint’s myriad of colors. The breed was named the Javanese after the Isle of Java, an island in Indonesia to the west of Bali. The Javanese isn’t from Java any more than the Balinese is from Bali, but it was believed that the name lent a nice romantic sound to the new breed.

On May 1, 2008, the Javanese officially became a color division of the Balinese, and in 2010 a single standard was adopted, fully combining the","Medium size.

The Bombay is an endearing breed: playful, loving, lighthearted, and agreeable to just about any suggestion from their family, particularly if that includes an invigorating game of fetch or a cuddle on the couch.

Due to their hybrid heritage, Bombays strike a pleasing balance between the moderate American Shorthair and the frisky, vocal Burmese. However, since the American Shorthair is less prominent today, Bombays tend to be more like the Burmese than like the American Shorthair.

They are very clever and people-oriented (thanks to the Burmese background), but won’t talk your ear off every second of the day (thanks to the American Shorthair). However, Bombays will get their thoughts across if they have something vital to impart, and you can count on them to stare you down with those hypnotizing copper eyes and repeat the message until you give them your full attention. They want quite a bit of attention, and they are clever in their attempts to gain your notice. When you sit down, don’t be surprised to see your Bombay sitting beside you moments later.

Bombays are very attached to their families and tend to love the entire family rather than bond with one person. Some say they are particularly good with well-behaved children. Known for their curiosity and high intelligence, Bombays love to follow their human companions all over the house. They love to keep an eye on every move and help with every chore. This doesn’t get the chores done faster, but it’s certainly entertaining.","The Bombay began in the 1950s by Nikki Horner. She wanted to develop a cat that possessed the look of the Burmese but with a sleek black coat and copper eyes instead of brown fur and yellow eyes—sort of a pint-sized panther. She named the breed after Bombay, India, land of the black leopard.

She found a black American Shorthair male that had the rich eye color she wanted and crossed him with one of her best Burmese. After much trial and error, Horner finally produced the results she was looking for: a cat with the body type and short polished coat of the Burmese, and the American Shorthair’s copper-colored eyes and black color. However, Horner soon found that creating a breed, even one as striking as the Bombay, doesn’t mean recognition or acceptance. It wasn’t until 1970 that the breed was accepted for registration by the CFA.

The Bombay is considered an Asian self-colored shorthair. While still uncommon in both the United Kingdom and in North America, the breed has a dedicated following.","Body

30,"The British Shorthair is a compact, well-balanced, and powerful cat, with a short, very dense coat. They often convey an overall impression of balance and proportion in which no feature is exaggerated.",British Shorthair,"If you’re looking for a cat that will loot your refrigerator and swing dizzily from your chandeliers, then the British Shorthair is not for you. Some say the British Shorthair is the perfect household companion if you like a breed that’s undemanding, not always underfoot or in your face. British Shorthairs like to keep a low profile; they are affectionate but not clingy, playful but not overactive. They are quiet, even-tempered, and undemanding with a bit of typical British reticence, particularly when they’re first introduced.

When they get over their initial reserve, however, they become extremely faithful companions. British Shorthair need love and attention if they are to become the loyal, loving companions they can be; the more attention and affection you give them, the more they will repay you in kind. Once they get to know and trust you, British Shorthair are confident and devoted, and enjoy following you from room to room to keep an eye on your activities. They are calm, quiet companions, appreciating quality time without demanding your total attention.

British Shorthair can make great apartment cats, being alert and playful without being hyper or destructive. British Shorthairs tend to show their loyalty to the entire family rather than select one person with whom to bond. They tend to be more independent than many breeds and usually adapt well to most situations. British Shorthairs tend not to be vocal cats; they make tiny squeaking sounds rather than meows, which is quite humorous coming from those burly bodies. They make up for it by some of the loudest purring you’ve ever heard; British Shorthairs are often known for their motor boat type purrs.

One thing Brits are not, however, is lap cats. They’d much rather sit beside you, or curl up at your feet, than cuddle on your lap. British Shorthairs dislike being picked up, and tolerate it with legs stiffly stretched out to push you away. They detest being kissed, too, but head presses are acceptable, and they accept petting with great enthusiasm and mighty purrs of appreciation. They get along with other animals in the home, including dogs as long as the proper introductions are made. British Shorthairs are at their very best with children, and children love these plush smiling friends.","The British Shorthair is native to Great Britain in the same way that the American Shorthair is native to America—long ago it was transported there from somewhere else. However, the progenitor of the Brit, as it’s affectionately called, is probably Great Britain’s oldest natural breed of cat, and was roaming around Great Britain for centuries before its cousin journeyed to the New World.

In many ways, the British Shorthair’s struggle for recognition resembles the American Shorthair’s in North America. Both began as working cats and weren’t appreciated as the special breeds they are for many years. The British Shorthair originated from a common street cat once called the European Shorthair. This breed, whose appearance is much different from the Brits you’ll see today, came to Great Britain some 2,000 years ago, courtesy of the Roman Empire. As they conquered and colonized other lands, the Romans brought cats along with them to protect their homes from rodents. These cats had been obtained from the Egyptians, who were very tight-pawed with their treasured felines. Eventually, however, Phoenician caravans transported them along trade routes, and Roman armies smuggled them out of Egypt and carried them along to many lands. Although the Phoenicians first introduced cats to England, the Romans were most likely responsible for their widespread establishment when Rome invaded the British Isles. Eventually, the Romans were driven from the Isles, but the cats they had brought with them remained.

The cats left behind didn’t look like today’s British Shorthair. Lithe with long, elegant bones, these cats were sandy brown or yellow-gray in color, with ticked coats like the Abyssinian and tabby markings on their face, legs, and tail. They were probably members of, or closely related to, the African wildcat, Felis silvestris lybica, the progenitor of all domestic cats. After arriving in Europe, however, they mixed with the European wildcat, Felis silvestris silvestris, a local wildcat subspecies inhabiting most of Europe. This caused a shift in both coat and body style, since the European wildcat has a broad head, small wide-set ears, a sturdy, muscular body, and short, thick fur.

Some European wildcats bear the mackerel tabby pattern; this common tabby pattern found today in so many breeds and mixed-bred cats may have arisen from the European wildcat. Because of the colder and wetter conditions, the cats in Europe developed stocky, muscular body styles and thicker, water-repelling coats that were favorable to the climate. For hundreds of years, these cats earned their livings protecting from rodents in Great Britain’s barns, granaries, alleys, gardens, and households. From these working cats, the British Shorthair developed into a stalwart, substantial breed. In the 1800s, residents started to appreciate these hardy alley cats for their beauty, strength, personality, and their value as companions.

Blue British Shorthairs, at first simply called “Shorthairs,” were favorites of cat enthusiast Harrison Weir. Mr. Weir was instrumental in getting the British Shorthair recognized as a breed in its own right.  While they became popular for some time there after, just before the turn of the century, longhaired exotics caught people’s eye and British Shorthairs declined in popularity. Nevertheless, British Shorthairs held their own until the chaos of World War II decimated the breed, along with most other European breeds as well. After the war, efforts were dedicated to preserving the British Shorthair breed. It took many generations to bring the breed back to their former glory, but eventually they prevailed.

Americans took little notice of the British Shorthair until the 1960s.  In 1970, ACFA recognized the breed for championship in only one color—solid blue—and under the now obsolete name “British Blue.” Blue was, and still is, the most common color both here and in Great Britain. The breed slowly earned supporters, and between 1970 and 1980 British Shorthairs were officially recognized in all the many colors of the breed. Today, the British Shorthair has an active following. In Great Britain, the breed also has many fans.","Body

31,"The Burmese is a cat of medium size with substantial bone structure, good muscular development, and a surprising weight for their size. This together with a rounded head, expressive eyes, and a sweet expression presents a totally distinctive cat who is comparable to no other breed.",Burmese,"Many say that Burmese are amusing, playful, and super-smart, the perfect interactive cats for the home —or any place people are in need of love and amusement. Devoted, loving cats, Burmese are often loyal and people-oriented. Burmese will give you unconditional love even when you are not your most loveable.

Burmese seem to never grow up; they are as entertaining at 16 weeks as they are at 16 years. These streaks of brown lightning love to perform animated antics for your amusement and theirs. Full of high-spirited playfulness, they love to entertain their families by performing daring leaps to the top of the bookcase, pausing only to make sure their audience is watching. If their antics go unnoticed, they hop right down and fix you with an unflinching stare, demanding attention. Burmese are a very determined breed, and will win just about any battle of wills.

There may be temperament differences between adult males and females. Females are intelligent, highly curious, active, and deeply emotionally involved with their human companions. Males are wholly devoted to their humans too, but are a bit more moderate in temperament. After a game of fetch or hide and seek (they hide, you seek), they like to lounge about, usually on top of what ever you’re doing. The only issue about which they are passionately concerned is the selected cuisine and how soon it will be served.

Burmese have a unique rasp to their voices and sound a bit like cats going hoarse from too much talking. However, Burmese are not as talkative as their Siamese neighbors, unless they have something important to express. Then they’ll reiterate the message repeatedly until you get out your universal feline/human translator and take care of whatever is troubling them.","The Burmese as we know and love it today can be traced back to a single female domestic cat named Wong Mau. In 1930, Wong Mau was transported into the United States from Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar), by Dr. Joseph Thompson of San Francisco. As the story goes, an unnamed sailor gave the feline to Dr. Thompson, who brought her home to the City by the Bay. Wong Mau was a small, fine-boned cat with a compact body, a rounded, short-muzzled head, round eyes set far apart, and a short, walnut-brown coat with darker brown on her face, ears, feet, and tail.

Dr. Thompson was very taken with Wong Mau, since she looked like cats he’d seen in Tibet. Dr. Thompson had served as a U.S. Navy doctor for some years and developed a strong interest in Southeast Asia. He spent time in a monastery in Tibet and was enchanted by the shorthaired, solid brown cats in the area. These felines, called “copper cats” in their native land for their rich brown color, have existed in Southeast Asia for centuries. They were depicted and described in the ancient text The Cat-Book Poems, a manuscript of verses and paintings written in the city of Ayutthaya, Siam, some time between 1350 c.e. when the kingdom was founded, and 1767 c.e. when the city was destroyed by invaders. As the legend goes, the Burmese is a descendant of a breed once worshipped in Burmese temples as embodiments of gods. The Cat-Book Poems also shows pictures of Siamese and what is likely Korat cats, suggesting these cats existed as separate, definable breeds for centuries.

Dr. Thompson was so taken with Wong Mau’s beauty and personality that the doctor wanted to create a program to isolate Wong Mau’s distinguishing characteristics so he could reproduce her type and color. He enlisted the help of several people, including that of anoted geneticist Dr. Clyde E. Keeler of Harvard University. Wong Mau was crossed with a sealpoint Siamese male named Tai Mau. The resulting kittens showed three different colors and patterns: beige, sable brown, and pointed. In the process, Dr. Thompson discovered that Wong Mau herself was a Siamese hybrid—half Siamese and half Burmese, what we would call a Tonkinese today. Since the pointed pattern is a recessive trait and a cat must inherit a copy of the gene from both parents to have the pattern, Wong Mau herself must have possessed the gene for the pointed pattern. Later, it was discovered that the Burmese gene responsible for the sable color is a member of the albino series of gene alleles. The Burmese gene causes solid black to appear dark sable brown by reducing the amount of pigment in the hair.

In 1936, CFA accepted the Burmese for registration, and Burmese cats were an immediate hit when they were introduced into North America in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Most cat lovers took an immediate liking to these beautiful brown cats. The results of the original program were published in the April 1943 Journal of Heredity, written by Dr. Thompson, Virginia Cobb, Billie Gerst, and Dr. Clyde E. Keeler. Unfortunately, Dr. Thompson died of a heart attack while the paper was in publication. The paper brought the Burmese more attention and fans.

The actual look of the Burmese has changed over time, achieving the diversity and current appearance through the years. Almost thirty years ago, two distinct head types emerged: the Contemporary Burmese and the European Burmese.","Medium in size, muscular in development, and presenting a compact appearance.

The Burmilla’s appearance is that of an elegant cat of foreign type and medium size.",Burmilla ,"The Burmilla’s temperament gives you the best of both its parent breeds—the personality of the active, mischievous, demanding Burmese is tempered by the tranquil, easy-going, affectionate Chinchilla Persian. Some have raved about the Burmilla’s unique and captivating personality. Adventurous and bold as kittens, Burmillas grow into sweet-natured, people-oriented adults. Not as active as the Burmese, Burmillas are still are full of life and enjoy a good game of catnip toy wrangling. Their favorite games, however, are those they share with their human companions. Whirling feathers, laser light toys, round toys to fetch again and again—these throw the Burmilla into an ecstasy of delight. A ball of scrap paper will serve just as well, provided you’re there to share the fun.

Like the Burmese, they are also very curious and intelligent; whatever you have hidden in that closed room or closet is cause for a full investigation by the inquisitive Burmilla. This determined breed will figure out a way into that closed door or cupboard, particularly if they notice you’d rather they didn’t. Anything left out in the open is fair game, too; don’t expect keys, socks, glass cases, pens, or the contents of your purse to remain where you put them. Small movable items immediately become toys. Watch out: you may catch your Burmilla tapping out texts to their Burmilla buddies.

After a good romp, your loyal and loving Burmilla will want to cuddle into your lap or arms, or curl up beside you on the couch for some petting, purring, and catnapping. Not overly vocal, Burmillas do have a loud, deep-throated purr that they switch on the moment you slide your hand down their silky backs. In all, it’s the Burmilla’s intelligent, affectionate, enthralling personality that wins the breed’s many fans.","The Burmilla cat breed originated in England in the early 1980s, by an accidental crossing between a silver Chinchilla male named Jemari Sanquist and a platinum European Burmese female named Bambino Lilac Fabergé.

Englishwoman, Miranda Bickford-Smith had acquired Sanquist as a pet for her husband. However, shortly before Sanquist was to be neutered he had crossed with a Burmese female. Soon after, it was clear that Burmese Bambino would have a litter fathered by Chinchilla Sanquist.  Bambino gave birth on September 11, 1981 to four Chinchilla/Burmese hybrids, all shorthaired shaded silver females. Bickford-Smith named the kittens Galatea, Gemma, Gabriela, and Gisella, and in a few weeks so was impressed with their attractive foreign type and short dense coats that she called friend a Therese Clarke, to give her opinion of the cats. Clarke shared Bickford-Smith’s excitement about the appearance and temperament of the hybrids, and they teamed up to develop them as the foundation of a new breed.

Clarke was particularly impressed with Galatea and Gemma from that first litter, so she kept Gemma to establish the beginnings of the Burmilla lines while Bickford-Smith kept Galatea to do the same. A crossing between the longhaired Chinchilla Persian and the shorthaired Burmese will always produce shorthaired offspring, because one copy of the recessive gene for long hair must be inherited from each parent for long hair to appear in a kitten’s physical appearance. Therefore, Gemma and Galatea were both shorthaired, but both also carried the recessive gene for long hair from their Chinchilla father, and the recessive solid or ‘self’ gene from their Burmese mother. Both also had appealing foreign body and head types, and Clarke and Bickford-Smith decided that the new breed should resemble Gemma and Galatea, yet be different enough not to be taken for any existing breed.

They then came up with a name for their new breed. With a bit of thought they came up with the Burmilla (“Burm” for the Burmese, and “illa” for the Chinchilla); and thought Burmilla had a nice ring to it. In 1983 Miranda Bickford-Smith became interested in the different varieties that were being produced during the breed’s development, while Clarke was focusing on the original shorthaired Burmilla blueprint. Therefore, they agreed to expand their efforts and would develop the breed in two different ways: Bickford-Smith would develop the Burmilla and its additional colors and hair lengths, and Clarke would focus on the type of Burmilla seen in the foundation cat Gemma. In 1984, Bickford-Smith and Clarke formed the Burmilla Cat Club to promote their new breeds.

In 1995, the breed crossed the Atlantic and was introduced to North America. The Burmilla Enthusiasts of America was formed to promote and advance the breed. Now recognized by five associations, the breed is catching on with Americans. Today the Burmilla is seen in both long and short hair lengths.","Body

Calico cats are wonderful! Keep in mind, calico cats are not a breed. Instead, calico refers to their tri-color coats which include black, orange and white. ""Dilute"" calicos may have gray, beige and white instead. Despite rumors to the contrary, calico cats are not all female, either—out of every 3000 calico kittens, one might be male! Several breeds of cats and mixtures of domestic cats can be calicos, including the American shorthair, Siberian and Japanese bobtail. Calico personalities can be as varied as their coats.

 

Rumored to be a bit feistier than other cats, recent studies confirm that pet parents have this perception, but NOT that calicos have this behavior. It may just be that calico lovers enjoy this perception and it’s been perpetuated.

 

That said, with so many cat parents saying they love their calico’s quirky nature, consider a calico if you’d like a kitty that will tell you what’s on her mind. As every calico is unique and from different heritage, their stats may range from 1-5 based on the individual.",Calico ,"Often called playful, affectionate and strong-willed, calicos have a reputation for being quirky. A 2015 study out of the University of California, Davis found that calico cat’s families reported that calicos may be more likely to hiss or otherwise say “back off” more often when compared to reports by cat parents of cats with other colors. But the study raises an eyebrow.

The researchers did not directly observe the cats and their behavior. This poses much leeway on the definition of “aggressive behaviors.” Without a standard measurement of “aggression,” it is easy to get a wide range of what constitutes and does not constitute aggression.

Researchers did acknowledge that other factors may be influencing a cat’s personality as well, like their breed, if they are neutered or not and what their home environment is like. There was also the possibility that parents mistake behavior as aggressive when, in actuality, it was an anxious response to stimuli.

So, what’s the bottom line? All calicos are unique. Because calico refers to coat characteristics and not a breed, it’s possible for calicos to have a wide range of dispositions. There are always other factors that come into play, such as their socialization and kittenhood environment.

The calicos we’ve met have been lovingly and adorably spunky, and excellent additions to their families!","The distinguishing orange-black-white of the calico is a genetic mutation that can be traced back to Egypt. The mutation was found in port cities along the Mediterranean Sea, including cities in Italy, Spain and France. These trade routes in northern Africa and Europe helped spread more than just the goods being transported—they brought the calico to new places, even to the U.S. eventually.

Strangely enough, the calico is a social influencer with a history. They sailed with Japanese fisherman to supposedly provide protection during storms and to scare away the apparitions of envious ancestors.

Calico cats have been painted in artwork around the world from the work Utagawa Kuniyoshi and Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin. The infamous “beckoning cat” is an omen of good fortune and is often found outside businesses and homes around the world —the cat? A calico.

As a good luck omen, the calico may, in fact, work. A train station in the town of Kinokawa was saved in 2007 because of a calico. The townspeople appointed Tama, the local neighborhood stray, to the position of Station Master. She greeted passengers and drew in such a crowd that enough revenue was generated to save the train station from closing down. Maybe the calico does draw in good luck after all!

Station Master isn’t the only position calicos have held either. The calico has been dubbed the official cat of Maryland—to match its state bird, the oriole. The most famous, modern day calico is most likely Martha Stewart’s grumpy-faced Princess Peony. The adorable calico totes a mainly white body with black and orange on the tail and face. Her striking yellow-green eyes add an air of mystery to this sour-looking kitty.","Calico cat coats consist of three or more colors in their fur. They are typically black, white, orange or cream. The majority of the calico is white, and the other colors add a beautiful accent color found in patches along the body. Sometimes people mistakenly think a calico is a Tortoiseshell cat. But torties almost always have a brown hue as their base color with streaks of black and orange—with little to no white to be found on them.

Because calicos can belong to many different cat breeds, their fur length and other characteristics like face and nose shape vary from cat to cat.

The vast majority of calicos are female. The reason is that the coat colors in the calico come from a combination of two X chromosomes. The tri-color fur needs to have a pair of X chromosomes to appear. Since female cats have two X chromosomes, calicos will usually be female---but some males with an extra X--XXY--may have calico coloration. These cats will be male but also sterile and cannot create offspring.

Aside from Klinfelter’s Syndrome in males, calicos are generally healthy cats and live to 15 or longer, making them an awesome addition to any home.",1,../../../assets/cat-breeds/Calico.png,8,10,6,12,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0
34,"The Chartreux is a sturdy, shorthaired French breed coveted in antiquity for its hunting prowess and its dense, water repellent fur. This breed’s husky, robust type is sometimes termed primitive, neither cobby nor classic. Though amply built, Chartreux are extremely supple and agile cats; refined, never coarse nor clumsy.",Chartreux ,"Chartreux cats may have been invited in by monks to protect the monastery from rodents . Today, however, Chartreux cats are popular because they make terrific companions. Who can resist a cat that greets you with a mighty purr and an enigmatic smile? They are amiable, loyal, loving, and adaptable, and when you sit down next to your Chartreux, you invariably end up with an exquisitely soft lapful of adoring blue feline. Chartreux are the strong silent types of the cat fancy; they keep their comments to themselves, even when standing beside empty food dishes. Chartreux may open their mouths as if to meow, but no sound comes out. When they do vocalize, it’s usually with small chirps or trills—it’s amazing to hear tiny chirps come out of those large, powerful bodies and strong jaws. They do purr with the greatest enthusiasm, however, particularly when you’re serving up their favorite snack. In addition, quality time with their preferred persons always make them smile. Nevertheless, Chartreux cats have a quiet but well-developed sense of humor, and enjoy a good joke, particularly if it’s at your expense. Known for their hunting prowess and their strong hunting instinct, they love toys that move, preferably by human power. Feathered toys that whirl through the air are particular favorites. They easily learn to play fetch and enjoy frolicking with other felines and sometimes even an agreeable dog—and their human friends, of course. They are very intelligent cats; they quickly learn their names and if you like a good challenge you can even teach them to come when you call—if they’re in the mood, of course. This cat is the perfect feline friend; in return for a bowl of food, a clean litterbox, and a soft bed (yours) to sleep on, you get a constant companion that entertains, loves, and cheers you up with its angelic smile and sweet devotion.","The Chartreux (pronounced shär-TRUE), a true blue cat with a Mona Lisa smile and an amiable temperament, is France’s contribution to the cat fancy. Since the Chartreux has been around for so many centuries, it’s hard to say with certainty just where and when it first developed. Like most breeds with long histories, the Chartreux tale is the stuff of legends. The most popular account tells that the Chartreux was bred by monks at the Grande Chartreuse Monastery, the chief monastery of the Carthusian order, located north of Grenoble in southeastern France. As the story goes, the Carthusian order of monks at the monastery, in their spare time between praying, liqueur-making, and weapon-forging, bred Chartreux cats with the same skill and dedication with which they created their world-famous yellow and green Chartreuse liqueurs. Allegedly, they selectively bred the cats to have quiet voices so as not to disturb the monks’ meditations. It’s a lovely, romantic tale, but a tale is likely all it is, since the monastery’s records do not mention cats, blue or any other color. A mention of the Chartreux breed, however, is found in the 1749 36-volume Histoire Naturelle (Natural History) by French biologist Comte de Buffon, who lists four cat breeds common in Europe at that time: Domestic, Angora, Spanish, and Chartreux. According to Jean Simonnet’s definitive 1980 book The Chartreux Cat, the Chartreux probably came from the Near East, and the cat described as the Cat of Syria by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605), was likely its ancestor. In Jean Simonnet’s book, an illustration of the Cat of Syria shows a stocky cat with solid blue coloring and vivid, slightly almond-shaped copper colored eyes. Beside the cat, a brown mouse cowers, a testament to the Chartreux’s strong hunting instincts, and one of the reasons the breed was so highly prized. Brought to Europe from the Near East countries in merchant ships, the Chartreux became established as a French breed. That the Chartreux survived at all is a testament to the breed’s endurance and flexibility, since for many centuries members of the breed weren’t treated with the kindness and love they’ve earned today. Primarily street cats, they were prized for their rat-catching prowess and, for a time, for their luxurious pelts. As Jean Simonnet notes, “One can truly say that the Chartreux cats beloved to us formerly did not have the ‘best of times’ with our countrymen.” The modern history of the breed began in the 1920s when two sisters, Christine and Suzanne Leger, discovered a colony of plush, shorthaired blue cats in the city of Le Palais on Belle Ile Island off the coast of Brittany in northwest of France. These free-roaming cats lived on the grounds of a hospital and matched the description of the Chartreux. (The hospital was run, coincidentally, by a religious order.) The people of Le Palais called them “hospital cats,” and the Leger sisters were taken with their beauty and thick blue coats. Christine and Suzanne Leger were the first to work seriously with the breed, and in 1931 they exhibited the cats in Paris. The breed became popular, but  World War II intervened, decimating the country and the breed. After the war, the few remaining Chartreux were bred with blue British Shorthairs, Russian Blues, and Persians, to keep the bloodlines going. Today, du chat des Chartreux (The Chartreux Cat Club) works to preserve, promote, and protect the Chartreux. The Chartreux made its journey to the United States in 1970, when the late Helen Gamon of La Jolla, California, imported the first Chartreux from France. The breed achieved CFA championship status in 1987; today, all North American associations accept the Chartreux as a breed in its own right.","The Chartreux has a robust physique, with medium-long with broad shoulders and a deep chest.

No shelf or cupboard is safe from a persistent Cornish.","The first known Cornish Rex was born on July 21, 1950, on a farm in Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, England, when a tortoiseshell and white random-bred cat named Serena gave birth to five kittens. The litter contained one curly-coated orange and white male kitten, which Nina Ennismore, Serena’s owner, named Kallibunker. Kallibunker was noticeably different from his littermates. His hair was short and curly and, instead of possessing the cobby body like that of his littermates and mother, Kallibunker’s body was long and lithe. He had large ears, a slender tail, and a foreign wedge-shaped head. Interested in this mini-mutant mouser, Ennismore recognized that Kallibunker’s fur was similar to the wavy fur of the Astrex rabbit, since Ennismore had previously raised and exhibited rabbits. She got in touch with British geneticist A. C. Jude, who agreed that the fur of Kallibunker was similar to the Astrex rabbit’s fur. On the advice of Jude, Ennismore backcrossed Kallibunker to his mother. This mating produced a litter containing one straight-coated kitten and two curly-coated kittens. A second mating was arranged for Kallibunker and his mom, and again curly-coated kittens were produced. The name Cornish Rex was decided upon for the new breed because of the breed’s Cornish origin and the resemblance to the Astrex rabbit.  Two Cornish Rexes arrived in North America in 1957, courtesy of fancier Fran Blancheri. The CFA accepted the Cornish for championship in 1964; all the North American registries now accept the Cornish Rex.

Britches, tufts of hair between the toes and full furnishings in the ears distinguish the Cymric.",Cymric,"The personality of the Cymric has won a strong following. Cymrics are intelligent, fun-loving cats, and they get along well with other pets, including dogs. Cymrics are particularly noted for their loyalty to their humans and enjoy spending quality time with them. As cats go, they can be easily taught tricks. Despite their playful temperament, they are gentle and nonaggressive. Their playful yet tractable dispositions make the Cymric a good choice for families with children. Cymrics are powerful jumpers and if sufficiently motivated will manage to breach the most secure shelf. They are also fascinated by water, as long as you don’t dunk them in the nasty stuff. Perhaps this fascination comes from originating on a small piece of land surrounded by it.","Presumed by researchers to have been introduced to the Isle of Man by human settlers and explorers, the Manx has existed there for many centuries. The Isle, located in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland, has no indigenous domestic cat species, and several theories exist about the introduction of domestic cats. Speculated sources include arrival with the Spanish Armada, Phoenician traders, or Viking settlers who colonized the Isle of Man. Records have been found that describe the cat as a mutation among the island’s domestic cats, rather than a cat that arrived with its tail already absent. In this case, the lack of tail is governed by a dominant gene, unlike most other breeds with short tails. This indicates that the Manx and the Cymric (KIM-ric) are not related to breeds, such as the Japanese Bobtail whose tails are governed by recessive genes. Manx cats are noted in early American cat registry records as well. The Cymric apparently has been around as long as the Manx itself. While the Cymric was shown in ACA as early as 1963, the breed didn’t really begin to take hold until the mid-1970s. First shown under the name Longhaired Manx, the name was changed to Cymric during this period. The word is the Welsh name for Wales and was chosen by pioneer Cymric breeders Blair Wright and Leslie Falteisek. In 1976, CCA was the first to accept the Cymric for championship status; it now has full championship standing in most associations. CFF is the only association that does not accept the Cymric; however, the reason they have not done so is that no group of fanciers has campaigned for acceptance. In May 1994, CFA changed the name from Cymric to Longhair Manx; both hair lengths share a single breed standard. Because only hair length separates the two breeds, CFA breeders campaigned for the Cymric to be considered part of the Manx breed. Longhaired kittens born to Manx parents (possible when both parents carry the recessive gene for long hair) can be registered as Cymrics in all associations except CFF. This eliminates the previous status problems with “split litters” in which both hair lengths are present. The Cymric and the Manx are two of the most challenging to breed because of the Manx gene. Cymric embryos that are homozygous (inheriting the Manx gene from both parents) die in the womb. Homozygous kittens comprise roughly one fourth of the kittens conceived; therefore, Cymric litters are usually small (see Manx profile, page 187). Even heterozygous kittens can have deformities such as, spina bifida, fusions of the spine, and defects of the colon, therefore any breeding must be planned with great care to minimize the defects.","Body

The Devon Rex is a breed of unique appearance. The breed's large eyes, short muzzle, prominent cheekbones, and huge, lowset ears create a characteristic elfin look. A cat of medium fine frame, the Devon is well covered with soft, wavy fur. The fur is of a distinctive texture, as the mutation that causes its wavy coat is cultivated in no other breed.",Devon Rex,"Devons have been compared to pixies, elves, and, of course, space aliens for their jumbo-sized satellite-dish ears, large, mischievous “window-to-the-soul” eyes, and ethereal appearance. People laud the playful “poodle cat,” as the breed is affectionately called, as people-oriented snugglers that love nothing better than to cuddle up with you at night and wake you in the morning with hugs, kisses, and purrs of affection. Moreover, since the Devon sheds less than other breeds, you can snuggle back without fear of covering yourself in as much cat hair. However, there are many other reasons to acquire a Devon besides their curly coats. Their loyalty, devotion, playfulness, courage, and intelligence set them apart from other breeds, just to name a few of the qualities that make them a good choice for the cat-obsessed. Devons are shoulder perchers, lap sitters, tail waggers, and retrievers of tossed cat toys. They have a well-developed sense of curiosity and want to be involved in whatever you’re doing, whether it’s peeling potatoes for dinner or taking a quick dip in the shower. Your Devon will hop into the bathtub before it’s dry, just to see what you were up to; a bit of water can’t dampen your Devon’s curiosity, or its thirst to constantly be by your side.","The Devon Rex can be traced back to a single cat in 1960. The father of the Devon breed, a feral, curly-coated tom, lived around an abandoned tin mine near Buckfastleigh, a small town in the county of Devon in southwest England, which borders Cornwall, the birthplace of the Cornish Rex. The curly-coated tom mated with a straight-coated calico female, producing a litter of kittens in the garden of cat lover Beryl Cox. One of the kittens, a brownish-black male that Cox named Kirlee, had the same short, curly coat as his father. At first, Beryl Cox thought Kirlee was a Cornish Rex, since the Cornish’s birthplace was not far away from her county of Devon. Subsequent matings between Kirlee and the cats of Cornish Rex breeder Brian Stirling-Webb resulted in only straight-coated offspring, from which Cox and Webb concluded that the two breeds were unrelated. It is now thought that Kirlee’s calico mother and the curly-coated feral male that was her father must have been related, since the Devon Rex gene that governs the curly coat is recessive and must be inherited from both parents to manifest in offspring. Kirlee must have inherited one copy of the gene from each of her parents. The name Devon Rex was adopted. The first Devon was imported to the United States in 1968. In 1972, ACFA became the first U.S. association to accept the Devon for championship. The Devon was accepted by TICA in 1979 (the year TICA was formed). The CFA accepted the Devon for championship in 1983. Today all North American cat associations accept the Devon for championship. In addition, the Devon is accepted for championship in Europe by The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) and the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe).","Body

A relative of the domestic short and medium haired cats, the domestic long hair is a sight to behold. With their regal coat measuring anywhere from two to six inches, these cats have a variety of personalities, fitting in a wide array of homes and are the second most popular cats in the U.S.

Because the long hair gene is a recessive trait, only 10% of cats are considered long haired. Domestic long hairs are not a recognized breed, so may have a wide and mixed ancestry. Some domestic long hair cats have tufted ears in addition to their long coats and may share a relative with ear-tufted breeds, like the Maine coon and American bobtail. It’s hypothesized that the domestic long hair dates back 400 years to the wintery regions of the countries of Persia, Russia and Turkey, where long, warm coats helped them survive.

Because domestic long hair cats have a mixed background, each will have a unique temperament—from the stealthy to the cuddly, the domestic long hair is a great choice for any sized family looking to bring a new family member into the household.

Fun fact: the domestic long hair cats are the perfect candidates for fur donation! Their long, thick fur is collected and used to make hair booms used to clean up oil spills, keeping our water and wildlife clean and healthy.",Domestic Long Hair,"The personality of the domestic long hair is as wide and varied as their coat colors, making each cat truly unique. If you’re considering adopting a domestic long hair cat, get to know their individual likes, dislikes and behaviors. Most long hairs tend to be playful, affectionate and easy-going. Others may be a bit slower to warm up or prefer a bit more space.","Though many are medium build, the domestic long hair’s particular body shapes are heavily influenced by their unique ancestry and genes. Faces may be long or short. Some may have muscular bodies while others are leaner. It’s possible for some of these cats to have a stouter appearance with flat-looking face and others may have an elongated face accompanied by a pointy nose. The vastness of physical variety makes the long hair an often striking and unique beauty.

Long hairs typically weigh anywhere from 8 to 15 pounds and the males tend to weigh more than their female counterparts.

Their mixed genetic pool gives them an advantage, as they are not more predisposed to any health issues as any other cat.

Coat: Long Hair
Domestic long hairs who are healthy and groomed well often exude elegance, although sometimes their goofy personalities may disrupt any sense of regality! They share many similarities to their short haired cousins such as a medium physical build, and their distinguishing feature is their 2 to 6 inch fur.

These luscious coats come in a variety of combinations from a single color such as black to the classy tuxedo look or even calico, torbie and tabby.

A domestic long hair cat’s coat typically takes some diligent care to avoid matting. Cat parents can anticipate brushing daily or every few days, checking for mats regularly and clipping claws approximately once or twice a month. Mats should be addressed by a professional groomer to avoid injury to the cat’s skin. Any matted fur will need to be addressed as soon as possible as it does pose risk of skin infection.

One of the most adorable features of some domestic short hairs is their neck ruffs—fur that extends beyond their heads to give the appearance of broader heads. Some may also have foot tufts and ear tufts—fur that sticks out between toes and out of ears—these too add a unique, ultra-cute characteristic to the long hairs","Body

The domestic medium hair is a playful cat found in households across the world. This feline is a close cousin to the domestic shorthair and domestic long hair. The big difference? The domestic medium hair has a unique gene that gives it its defining, luxurious mid-length fur. If not for this gene, the domestic shorthair and medium hair would look quite similar. Interestingly, a domestic medium hair can be the offspring of either a domestic shorthair or domestic long hair cat. The opposite is also true: a domestic medium hair can produce either short or long-haired kittens.

Not technically considered a breed, domestic medium hairs are lovingly considered the “mutt” of the cat world. Their signature medium-length, double coat is less common than short fur, and these fuzzier felines tend to be a little larger and heavier than their shorthair cousins.

Due to their genetic variety, medium-haired cats have a wide range of personalities and physical features. Some love cuddles while others prefer their independence, making it easy to come across a cat who is the perfect fit for any family.

You’ll find that U.S. shelters are filled with wonderful medium hair felines all looking for their forever home. They’re easy to find and great to adopt!",Domestic Medium Hair,"Cat lovers around the world won’t have a hard time finding a domestic medium hair that matches their family’s lifestyle. This cat’s mixed genetic pool not only gives them their unique appearance but also produces a range of distinct personalities.

Some domestic medium hairs appreciate generous sessions of love and attention from their pet-parents. Others have a more independent streak. It’s not unusual to find some who are quiet and reserved and others who love to practice their meow and demonstrate their agility.

Domestic medium hairs tend to get along well with children and other pets, especially if they are properly socialized as kittens. They can be quite playful, particularly when young, and will enjoy bonding with their family by playing together with bell cat toys, fun feathers or an indoor cat tree.

Like all cats, make sure you play and touch their ears, face and paws frequently when they are still kittens to help familiarize them with being handled. This gives kittens their best chance to develop into an affectionate and relaxed adult cat.","Cats first made their way to the Americas when the pilgrims came on the Mayflower, though cats were domesticated long before by the ancient Egyptians, around 2000 BC.

On the voyage to the Americans, the ancestors of the domestic medium hair cat were tasked with the important job of rodent control. They helped protect stored food and helped keep passengers safe from rodent-borne diseases.

Early settlers adopted them as barnyard cats. Countless generations later, the domestic medium hair can be found across the U.S. continent and throughout the world.","Body
These feline fur balls tend to be a bit heavier than their short-haired cousins. The domestic medium hair ranges anywhere from 11 to 22 pounds and males tend to be bigger than females. They also have slightly longer lifespans, averaging 15 to 17 years. Differences aside, they share a similar medium-sized and muscular build. Their delightful genetic variety gives us furry cats who are slender and long and others who are short and stout.

Domestic medium hair cats have a head that is a bit angular. You’re not likely to notice this because their fur softens the facial shape. Their ears are pointed and upright. Of course, you’ll quickly spot their signature fluffy tail, which has a feathery quality.

A generally healthy cat, like many household felines the domestic medium hair has been known to overeat when allowed to free-feed. Be sure to watch their diet, as overeating can lead to obesity and secondary diseases such as arthritis or diabetes.

The domestic medium hair cat is a beautiful member of the feline family who might steal your heart with a wave of the tail.

Coat
Their defining feature—a silky, medium-length double coat—gives them a fluffy, soft appearance, enticing everyone who sees them to want to cuddle up! Whether a cat welcomes all-night snuggles and couch cuddle sessions will depend on their individual temperament.

The medium hair can vary greatly in fur color. They can be black, orange, gray, or white or any color of the cat-fur rainbow. It’s easy to find them in a single color, two-toned like, tuxedos, or tri-colored calicos. And let’s not forget the tabby! Their coat, while fairly easy to maintain, will benefit from a weekly brushing.

The domestic shorthair cat is competing for most popular pet in the U.S. with an approximate 80 million in the states out of the estimated 600 million around the world. In fact, the great majority, almost 95%, of U.S. cats are considered domestic shorthairs.

 

Keep in mind that the domestic shorthair is not really a breed. Known as “moggie” by the English, the cats have a blended ancestry and may be more akin to “mutts” in the dog world than their own unique breed. Since domestic shorthair cats are a combination of different breeds, they vary greatly in fur color, personality and other traits - meaning adopting a domestic shorthair uniquely your own is easy!

 

These cuddly and playful cats are easy to love and are great for a variety of households and lifestyles.",Domestic Shorthair ,"The domestic shorthair personalities are as varied as they get. From playful to calm or vocal to quiet, no matter the personality, these cats are social when raised with humans and make great pets for most families, including those with other pets or children.
While they are descendants of cats who used to hunt mice, all cats are individuals and that means not all domestic shorthairs are going to want to chase mice or want to bring their parents “gifts.”

Domestic shorthair cats are known to be excellent at acrobatics like leaping and balancing. This becomes clear in their often-playful nature. Having a great, safe place for these cats to bird watch while keeping an eye on the household will keep these cats satisfied and mentally stimulated for hours on end.

Domestic shorthairs can be energetic and will probably be grateful for as many opportunities to keep their minds and bodies active. Scratching posts, feather toys and the classic cardboard box can quickly become favorites for these cats and provide plenty of mental and physical exercise for them.

Typically laid-back and carefree, these cats enjoy sunbathing and, like many other cats, they will enjoy an afternoon catnap just about anywhere, including your lap. Head scratches are a must for the highly affectionate domestic shorthairs and cat parents would do best to schedule in at least 15 minutes of play each day with them.","Most believe the ancient Egyptians domesticated cats about 4,000 years ago.
The domestic shorthairs are said to be descendants of the British shorthairs. Shorthairs are believed to have been brought along on the Mayflower and put to work, helping to minimize the rodent population on board. They landed in America with the pilgrims, who, upon arrival, kept these cats active.

In North America, these cats continued to work for their families. Their physical agility makes them ideal in keeping pests away from food storage and other places they shouldn’t be. This also kept families safe from whatever diseases these pests could have been carrying. Often left to reign in the barnyard, these cats did an excellent job of capturing prey in exchange for a warm, safe place to take a snooze, a little food and some love from their parents.

Though they themselves are not a breed, the domestic shorthairs are close relatives to the American shorthair and British shorthair—which are both cat breeds.","Domestic shorthairs range in appearance, without one color or pattern being predominant. Some have spots, some have patches and others may have a different colored tail than the rest of their body. Their smooth, shiny coats come in a variety of colors: brown, orange, black, white, and so on. Their eyes can be hazel, blue, green or gold.

All variety aside, some common physical traits amongst domestic shorthairs include their round head and paws, muscular bodies and medium tail-length. They tend to have a varied stature and can range anywhere from 6 to 16 pounds, though the females tend to be smaller than the males. Fun fact: their nighttime vision is six times better than humans!

The father of the Devon breed, a feral, curly-coated tom, lived around an abandoned tin mine near Buckfastleigh, a small town in the county of Devon in southwest England, which borders Cornwall, the birthplace of the Cornish Rex. The curly-coated tom mated with a straight-coated calico female, producing a litter of kittens in the garden of cat lover Beryl Cox. One of the kittens, a brownish-black male that Cox named Kirlee, had the same short, curly coat as his father. At first, Beryl Cox thought Kirlee was a Cornish Rex, since the Cornish’s birthplace was not far away from her county of Devon. Subsequent matings between Kirlee and the cats of Cornish Rex breeder Brian Stirling-Webb resulted in only straight-coated offspring, from which Cox and Webb concluded that the two breeds were unrelated. It is now thought that Kirlee’s calico mother and the curly-coated feral male that was her father must have been related, since the Devon Rex gene that governs the curly coat is recessive and must be inherited from both parents to manifest in offspring. Kirlee must have inherited one copy of the gene from each of her parents. The name Devon Rex was adopted. The first Devon was imported to the United States in 1968. In 1972, ACFA became the first U.S. association to accept the Devon for championship. The Devon was accepted by TICA in 1979 (the year TICA was formed).

The ideal Exotic should present an impression of a heavily boned, well balanced cat with a sweet expression and soft, round lines. The large, round eyes set wide apart in a large round head contribute to the overall look and expression. The thick, plush coat softens the lines of the cat and accentuates the roundness in appearance.",Exotic Shorthair,"While Persians and their relatives have a laid-back, mellow personality, Exotics are also playful and enjoy a good game of catching the catnip mouse between bouts of catching a few ZZZs. Because of the American Shorthair influence, Exotics are reported to be somewhat livelier than Persians. Undoubtedly, the Exotic personality is, if not identical, very much like the Persian’s—laidback, loyal, sweet, and affectionate. They want to be involved in their favorite humans’ lives and will quietly follow them from room to room just to see what they are doing. They also enjoy hugs and cuddles, and lavish their humans with purrs and licks of affection until the thick coat drives them away to lounge on cool kitchen linoleum or cold fireplace bricks. Because of the short coat, their guardians can spend more time playing with their Exotics than grooming them.","In the late 1950s American Shorthair fanciers, motivated by the popularity of the Persian, secretly began to mix Persians into their American Shorthair bloodlines to improve body type and to introduce the beautiful and favored silver Persian color into the American. (At that time and until 1965 American Shorthairs were known as Domestic Shorthairs.) Because of this hybridization, the boning of the American grew heavier, the head rounder, and the nose shorter, and the coat denser and longer. Other American Shorthair breeders, appalled at the changes occurring in the breed, became determined to disallow any Americans that showed signs of hybridization. Exotic Shorthairs might have faded away into cat fancy history if it wasn’t for the efforts of CFA judge Jane Martinke, and the Exotic Shorthair was first accepted for championship status by the CFA in 1967. CFA breeders were then allowed to shift their American Shorthair/Persian hybrids into the newly formed Exotic Shorthair classification. At first, Exotic breeders used Burmese and Russian Blues in addition to American Shorthairs to introduce the shorthair gene. As the breed began to gain in popularity, and as the gene pool grew larger, the CFA began limiting the outcrosses. In 1987 the CFA closed the Exotic to shorthair outcrosses altogether, leaving the Persian as the CFA’s only allowable outcross. In 1971, the first Exotic Shorthair achieved the status of grand champion.Today, the Exotic is one of the most popular purebred shorthairs.","Body

44,"The overall impression of the ideal Havana Brown is a cat of medium size with a rich, solid color coat and good muscle tone. Due to its distinctive muzzle shape, coat color, brilliant and expressive eyes, and large forward tilted ears, it is comparable to no other breed.",Havana,"More distinctive than the muzzle, ears, or mink-like coat is the Havana Brown’s personality. Although still quite rare, Havanas have built an enthusiastic following. Havana Browns are affectionate, gentle, highly intelligent, and, unlike their Siamese compatriots, quiet. They are remarkably adaptable and agreeable cats, and adjust to almost any situation with poise and confidence. Havanas must have human interaction if they are to live happy, healthy lives. They crave attention from their human companions and are not content unless they can be by your side, helping you with your household tasks. Havanas love to reach out and touch their favorite humans; they often nudge their human friends with an out-stretched paw as if asking for attention. Fetch is a favorite Havana game, and they can often be found carrying toys and stray objects around in their mouths. If you’ve misplaced a sock or some other small, easily carried object, check your Havana’s cat bed. You might find that it has magically found its way there.","The Havana Brown, a cat the color of chocolate, is another breed that comes from the mysterious land of Siam. Solid brown cats were described and depicted in The Cat-Book Poems, a manuscript of verses and paintings written in the city of Ayutthaya, Siam, some time between 1350 c.e. when the kingdom was founded, and 1767 c.e. when the city was destroyed by invaders from Burma. These brown cats appear in the manuscript alongside royal Siamese, black and white bicolors, and silver-blue Korats. The people of Siam considered the burnished brown cats very beautiful and believed they protected their human companions from evil. Solid brown (self-brown) cats were among the first felines to come to England from Siam (now Thailand) in the late 1800s. Early records describe these cats as “Siamese, with coats of burnished chestnut, and greeny-blue eyes.” It is believed that these imports were not all of the same genetic types, but rather represent what today would be called Burmese, chocolate point Siamese, Tonkinese (Burmese/Siamese hybrids), and Havana Browns. It’s hard to tell one from another from mere descriptions. Solid brown cats were exhibited in Europe during the late 1800s and the early 1900s. A brown took first prize at a show in England in 1888, indicating that, at that time, fanciers valued and treasured brown cats. At a 1928 cat show, the British Siamese Cat Club gave a special award to the cat with “the best chocolate body.” Writers of the day described these cats as “chocolate-colored Siamese, that is, the same color all over.” Soon after, however, self-browns fell from grace. In 1930 the Siamese Cat Club announced, “The club much regrets it is unable to encourage the breeding of any but blue-eyed Siamese.” Solid brown cats lacking blue eyes were accordingly banned from competition and disappeared from the cat fancy. Self-browns made their comeback in the early 1950s when a handful of English breeders decided brown was still beautiful. Working first separately and then together, these breeders studied chocolate gene inheritance and then started a breeding program, apparently using Siamese, domestic shorthairs, and Russian Blues. The breeders were striving to produce a solid-colored cat in the chocolate point coloring of the Siamese, rather than the sable coloring of the Burmese. At that time in England, the only recognized foreign breeds other than the Siamese were the Abyssinian and the Russian Blue. In 1952 the first solid chocolate kitten to be registered in England was born. This kitten, Elmtower Bronze Idol, became the foundation cat for the new breed. Bronze Idol was produced by mating a seal point Siamese that carried the chocolate gene with a solid black cat also carrying chocolate. The black cat was the offspring of a black cat bred to a seal point Siamese. Since chocolate coloration is governed by a recessive gene, Bronze Idol had to receive the gene from both parents to express the trait. In 1958, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy accepted the breed for championship competition under the name Chestnut Brown Foreign. Later, the breed was renamed Havana. Two stories exist regarding the naming of the breed. One claims that the Havana was named after a rabbit breed of the same color. The other maintains the Havana was named after the Havana tobacco because it has the color and matt appearance of a Havana cigar. The first Havanas reached America in the mid-1950s. The breed was recognized in 1959 under the name Havana Brown, and in 1964 CFA granted the Havana Brown championship status. In 1974, the gene pool was closed in North America, which many breeders felt was much too early in the breed’s development, given that the breed was, and still is, quite rare. By the early 1990s, Havana Brown numbers were dwindling, and breeding closely related cats was necessary because no unrelated cats were available. Breeders became very concerned about the Havana’s future as a viable breed, and they contacted Dr. Leslie Lyons Ph.D. at the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at University of California, Davis for help in developing an outcross program. The Winn Feline Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports studies to improve cat health, funded the project so Veterinary Genetics Laboratory could analyze the Havana Brown’s genetic makeup. The study showed the Havana badly needed outcrosses to maintain the breed’s health and diversity. Breeders petitioned CFA to open the breed to outcrossing. In 1997, CFA voted to allow the Havana Brown certain limited outcrosses to chocolate point and seal point Siamese, certain colors of Oriental Shorthairs (breeders favor solid ebony and solid chestnut), and unregistered solid black and solid blue domestic shorthairs. Kittens from a Havana Brown and an allowable outcross could then be mated back to a Havana Brown, at which point the offspring were considered registrable and showable Havana Browns provided they met the color standard. To date, breeders report the program has been successful in enlarging the gene pool and keeping the breed healthy.","Body
Torso medium in length, firm, and muscular. Adult males tend to be larger than their female counterparts. Overall balance and proportion rather than size to be determining factor. The neck is medium in length and in proportion to the body. The general conformation is mid-range between the short-coupled, thick set and svelte breeds.

Head
When viewed from above, the head is longer than it is wide, narrowing to a rounded muzzle with a pronounced break on both sides behind the whisker pads. The somewhat narrow muzzle and the whisker break are distinctive characteristics of the breed and must be evident in the typical specimen. When viewed in profile, there is a distinct stop at the eyes; the end of the muzzle appears almost square; this illusion is heightened by a well-developed chin, the profile outline of which is more square than round. Ideally, the tip of the nose and the chin form an almost perpendicular line. Allow for sparse hair on chin, directly below lower lip.

Ears
Large, round-tipped, cupped at the base, wide-set but not flaring; tilted forward giving the cat an alert appearance. Little hair inside or outside.

Eyes
Shape: aperture oval in shape. Medium sized; set wide apart; brilliant, alert and expressive. Color: any vivid and level shade of green; the deeper the color the better.

Legs & Paws
Ideal specimen stands relatively high on its legs for a cat of medium proportions in trunk and tail. Legs are straight. The legs of females are slim and dainty; slenderness and length of leg will be less evident in the more powerfully muscled, mature males. Hind legs slightly longer than front. Paws are oval and compact. Toes: five in front and four behind.

Tail
Medium in length and in proportion to the body; slender, neither whiplike nor blunt; tapering at the end. Not too broad at the base.

Coat
Short to medium in length, smooth and lustrous.

Rich and even shade of warm brown throughout; color tends toward red-brown (mahogany) rather than black-brown. Nose leather brown with a rosy flush. Paw pads rosy toned. Whiskers brown, complementing the coat color.",1,../../../assets/cat-breeds/Havana.png,8,11,6,10,4,1,3,3,1,3,2,5,5,4,0,0,0,0
45,"The Himalayan is a hybrid breed identical to the Persian, but distinguished by the points on the cats’ extremities (the facial mask, feet, ears, and tail) which results in a Persian-type cat with the coloring and deep blue eyes of the Siamese-patterned cat. The ideal Himalayan is a strong cat with excellent boning and musculature, a well-balanced cat, giving the impression of robust power.",Himalayan ,"“Himmies,” as they are sometimes called, are wonderful indoor cat companions. They are gentle, calm, and sweet-tempered, and possess a playful side as well. Like the Siamese, Himalayans love to play fetch, and a scrap of crumpled paper or a kitty toy will entertain them for hours, or until their next nap. Himalayans are devoted and dependent upon their humans for companionship and protection. They crave affection and love to be petted and groomed, which is fortunate, since every Himalayan owner will spend part of each day doing just that. Like their Persian siblings, they are docile and won’t harass you for attention the way some breeds will. They possess the same activity level as the Persian, and they are not vocal like the Siamese.","The first deliberate cross between a Siamese and a Persian was made in 1924 by a Swedish geneticist. In 1935 that the first pointed pattern longhair was born. In the early 1930s, two Harvard medical researchers crossed a Siamese female with a black Persian male, not to create a new breed, but to establish how certain characteristics were inherited. This mating produced a litter of black, shorthaired kittens. They then bred a black Persian female with a Siamese male. The outcome was the same. This is not surprising, since longhair and the colorpoint pattern are both governed by recessive genes. Both parents have to possess the genes in order for the traits to be expressed in the offspring. By crossing a female from the second litter with a male from the first, they produced Debutante, a cat that possessed the Siamese body type and color pattern and the long hair of the Persian. During the same year, British and American fanciers hoped to produce a pointed pattern breed with the Persian hair type and conformation. World War II interfered with these efforts. In 1950 American Marguerita Goforth succeeded in breeding the long awaited Persian-like colorpoint. CFA and ACFA recognized the breed in 1957 under the name Himalayan, named for the color pattern found in other animals such as the Himalayan rabbit. By 1961, all major U.S. cat associations recognized the Himalayan.

Because Himalayans are regularly crossed with Persians, many cat associations have special rules for Himalayan-Persian hybrids, usually allowing them to be shown either as Himalayans or Persians, depending upon their appearance. Whatever the breed is called, the Himalayan remains a popular breed with a solid following.","Body

The Japanese Bobtail presents the overall impression of a medium-sized cat with clean lines and bone structure, well-muscled but straight and slender rather than massive in build. The unique set of this cat’s eyes, combined with high cheekbones and a long parallel nose, lend a distinctive Japanese cast to the face. The short tail resembles a bunny tail with the hair fanning out to create a pom-pom appearance, which effectively camouflages underlying bone structure of the tail. Overall type, composed of balance, elegance, and refinement is essence of Japanese Bobtail breed.",Japanese Bobtail,"As elegant and clever as a Haiku, Japanese Bobtails are living works of art with their sculptured bodies, pert bobbed tails, alert ears, and large window-to-the-soul eyes. But they’re not just for admiring; they also possess a personality that will make you purr. Bobs make outstanding companions. Fearless and fierce as samurai warriors when on the hunt for a roving rodent or catnip mouse, Japanese Bobtails nevertheless passionately adore their human families and spend much of their waking hours at their favorite human’s side, chirping quiet queries and sticking curious noses into everyone’s business. They’re bold, intelligent, and energetic, and easily adjust to new people, situations, and animals, making them good show cats. Bobtails are very active; they are ever-present companions that stop short of being clingy. They want to be involved with their human companions and are more than willing to lend a paw when you need it—and even when you don’t. Bobtails also enjoy a good conversation; they have chirping voices that produce a wide range of tones; some breeders describe this as “singing.” Because of their high intelligence, Bobtails readily learn behaviors usually reserved for the canine crowd, such as fetching and learning to walk on a lead. Be careful what you teach them, however; if jumping on your stomach at three in the morning gets you up to feed them even once, they’ll jump on your stomach in the wee hours forevermore. Their intelligence can get them into mischief, since they are adept at opening cupboards and getting into off-limit rooms—and out of closed off rooms as well. At their most mischievous, how ever, they are loads of fun to watch. You’ll need no better excuse for neglecting the housework than watching the antics of your Japanese Bobtail at play.","No one knows for sure when and where the Japanese Bobtail originated, but it is believed that the ancestors of today’s Japanese Bobtail cats traveled from Korea and China to Japan around the beginning of the sixth century. They most likely were kept aboard ships to protect precious silk goods and documents being transported from port to port. Whether these seafaring cats had bobbed tails or not is not known; the origin of their bobbed tail mutation will probably never be known. It’s clear, however, that the breed has been bobbing around the Far East for many centuries, since early Japanese folklore contains numerous references to short-tailed cats. Bobtailed cats can be found in Japanese woodcut prints and silkscreen paintings from the Edo period (1603–1867), so they were not only well known in Japan but by the fifteenth century were prized for their grace and beauty, and were kept in the temples and homes of the Imperial Japanese families for many years. It’s safe to say the Japanese Bobtail is one of the oldest existing cat breeds with a history as rich with legends and folklore as the country in which it developed. Bobtailed cats born with a particular pattern of red, black and white markings were called Mi-Ke (pronounced mee-kay, meaning “three fur” in Japanese) were considered lucky; such cats were particularly treasured. The most famous story about the Mi-Ke is the legend of Maneki Neko, which means “beckoning cat” in Japanese. As the tale goes, a bobtailed, tri-colored cat named Tama lived at the poor Kotoku temple in Setagaya, Tokyo. The monk often shared his meager food with his beloved cat to make sure she got enough to eat. One day, Lord Ii Natotaka was caught in a rain storm near the temple. While he sought shelter under a nearby tree, he noticed Tama beckoning to him from the temple gate. A moment after he left the tree in response to the cat’s welcoming gesture, the tree was struck by lightning. Since Tama had saved his life, Lord Ii Natotaka took the temple as his family’s own, bringing it great prosperity. The lord renamed the temple Gotokuji and built a large new temple building. Tama, revered for bringing such good fortune, lived out her life in comfort and was buried with honors in the temple cemetery. Other legends about Maneki Neko abound, but all associate the cat with good luck and prosperity. Maneki Neko silkscreen paintings and other artwork were particularly popular in the Edo period. Today, figurines of Maneki Neko can be found in many Japanese shops, restaurants, and other businesses as charms to bring good fortune and success. These figurines clearly show the bobbed tail, the tri-colored pattern, and the raised beckoning paw. Japanese Bobtails might have remained pampered royal cats if not for the Japanese silk industry. Around the fifteenth century, when growing rodent populations threatened to destroy the silkworms and their cocoons from which the precious silk was harvested, the Japanese government ordered cats be set free to protect the silk industry. Afterward, Japanese Bobtails became street and farm cats, and after many years of survival on Japan’s streets and farms, natural selection turned the Japanese Bobtail into a hardy, intelligent, adaptable cat. Until quite recently, the Japanese Bobtail was considered a common working cat in its native land.

The Japanese Bobtail came to North America in 1968. In 1969, CFA accepted Japanese Bobtails for registration. In 1971, the breed was granted provisional status, and in 1976, the Jap","Body
Medium in size, torso long, lean, and elegant, not tubular, showing well developed muscular strength without coarseness. No inclination toward flabbiness or cobbiness. General balance of utmost importance. Neck neither too long nor too short, in proportion to the length of the body.

Head
Long and finely chiseled, head forms almost a perfect equilateral triangle (does not include the ears) with gentle curving lines, high cheekbones, and a noticeable whisker break; the nose long and well-defined by two parallel lines from tip to brow with a gentle dip at, or just below, eye level. Muzzle fairly broad and rounding into the whisker break; neither pointed nor blunt. Chin full, neither undershot nor overshot.

Ears
Large, upright, and expressive, set wide apart but at right angles to the head rather than flaring outward, and giving the impression of being tilted forward in repose.

Eyes
Large, oval rather than round, but wide and alert; set into the skull at a rather pronounced slant when viewed in profile. The eyeball shows a shallow curvature and should not bulge out beyond the cheekbone or the forehead.

Legs & Paws
Legs in keeping with the body, long, slender, and high, but not dainty or fragile in appearance. The hind legs noticeably longer than the forelegs, but deeply angulated to bend when the cat is standing relaxed so the torso remains nearly level rather than rising toward the rear. When standing, the cat’s forelegs and shoulders form two continuous straight lines, close together. Paws oval. Toes five in front and four behind.

Tail
Tail is unique not only to the breed, but to each individual cat. This is to be used as a guideline, rather than promoting one specific type of tail out of the many that occur within the breed. The tail must be clearly visible and is composed of one or more curves, angles, or kinks or any combination thereof. The furthest extension of the tail bone from the body should be no longer than three inches. The direction in which the tail is carried is not important. The tail may be flexible or rigid and should be of a size and shape that harmonizes with the rest of the cat.

Color
No color or pattern is preferred over any other. In the dominant colored bi-colors and tri-colors (Ml-KE) any color may predominate with preference given to bold, dramatic markings and vividly contrasting colors. In the dilute colored bi-colors and tri-colors (MI-KE), any color may predominate, with preference given to soft, muted markings and gently contrasting colors. In the solid color cat the coat color should be of uniform density and color from the tip to the root of each hair and from the nose of the cat to the tail. Nose leather, paw pads, and eye color should harmonize generally with coat color. Blue eyes and odd eyes are allowed. All colors with the exception of those showing evidence of hybridization resulting in the colors chocolate, lavender, point restricted (i.e. pointed pattern) or unpatterned agouti (i.e., Abyssinian coloring) or those colors with white.

Coat: Long Hair
Longhair: length medium-long to long, texture soft and silky, with no noticeable undercoat in the mature adult. Frontal ruff desirable. Coat may be shorter and close lying over the shoulders, gradually lengthening toward the rump, with noticeable longer hair on the tail and rear britches. Ear and toe tufts are often present

47,"Javanese cats are faithful companions who will follow you from room to room, chatting at you along the way. The Javanese shares many similarities with the Siamese, but there are subtle differences between the two.",Javanese,"Javanese cats, like their Balinese relatives, are playful, devoted, and always eager to tell you their views on life, love, and what you’ve served them for dinner. Javanese (and their Siamese relatives) have a fascination with food, and, while some will burn off the extra calories in playful antics, care must be taken that the less active don’t turn into butterballs.

Known for their curiosity, intelligence, and excellent communication skills, the Javanese breed is perfect if you want a responsive, interactive cat, one that will blow in your ear and follow you everywhere. Their meows seem definite attempts to communicate, and they look you directly in the eye and seem to answer when spoken to. Fanciers say that the Javanese are easy to train, and are not quite as demanding of your time and energy as are Siamese.","The Javanese is one breed in a line of designer Siamese-style cats that includes the Balinese, Colorpoint Shorthair, Oriental Shorthair, and Oriental Longhair. These breeds were inspired by breeders who wanted to take the qualities of the Siamese and alter the coat and colors to their liking. All of these breeds share similar conformations and personality types. The differences between these breeds lie in the coat length, colors, patterns, and the cat association to which you happen to subscribe.

The Siamese comes in four pointed colors: seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac. The Balinese is a long haired version of the Siamese in the same color schemes. The Colorpoint Shorthair comes in pointed colors outside the four traditional Siamese colors; they come in red, cream, tortie, and lynx points. The Javanese is a long haired version of the Colorpoint Shorthair.

The CFA is the only registry that separates the breeds into the classifications Colorpoint Shorthair and Javanese. The other registries merely extended the color parameters of the Siamese and the Balinese to include the wider range of colors. The CFA’s reasoning behind the separate designations is that Colorpoint Shorthairs and Javanese are hybrids, which they are, since these colors were created by crossing the Siamese with other breeds. However, some breeders feel that separating the Balinese and the Javanese is like splitting cat hairs; both breeds share a body type, personality, and coat, and the hybridization happened so long ago that it no longer matters. Other breeders zealously want the breeds kept separate to maintain the purity of the Siamese and Balinese lines.

The Javanese shares much of its history with the Balinese breed. The Javanese isn’t from the Isle of Java any more than the Balinese is from Bali; the name was bestowed because of the nice, romantic ring. One of the foundation cats of the Javanese breed was created by crossing a Balinese to a Colorpoint Shorthair. The result was a cat with all the characteristics of a Siamese but with a longer coat length and a color outside the basic four. These colorful longhairs were recognized by the CFA in 1987.","Body

As the story goes, new brides were given a pair of Si-Sawat cats to ensure happy, fortunate marriages. Other tales associate the Korat with ceremonies to bring critical rainfall to the new rice crops. One story tells how Korats were paraded through northeast Thai villages, being sprinkled with water to assure rain would fill the rice paddies with much-needed water. Whether these stories are true or not isn’t known, but they add to the mystique of the good luck cat of Siam.

They adore human companionship and adapt well to indoor or apartment living as long as they get the requisite amount of playing and pampering. Like most cats, LaPerms develop the closest bond with their human friends when they get regular human interaction and affection. LaPerms are agile and active. Like their barn cat ancestors, they enjoy a good game of chase, and love pouncing on the catnip mouse. They particularly enjoy interactive toys in which you take an active role. Inquisitive by nature, they always want to stick their noses into all household activities. Unlike many active breeds, the LaPerm is quite content to sit in your lap for some quality petting and pampering after they’re done racing about the house. Vocally quiet, LaPerms speak up only when they have something of extreme importance to say, such as bringing your attention to their empty food dishes. However, they enjoy an occasional quiet chat with their favorite people, particularly if their human companions are doing most of the chatting.","At first glance, the LaPerm looks like the cat just back from a grooming salon. However, Mother Nature is this breed’s only stylist. Also called the Dalles LaPerm, the LaPerm is one of the newly accepted breeds, and has been around since the 1980s. The LaPerm’s journey began in a cherry orchard in The Dalles, Oregon. In early March of 1982, an ordinary brown tabby barn cat named Speedy gave birth to six kittens. The owners, Linda and Richard Koehl, noticed one of the kittens looked very different from her littermates. Instead of the fine down that covered the bodies of her siblings, she was entirely bald. In addition, she was smaller than her littermates and had larger ears and a longer body. When the kitten was about eight weeks old, soft curly hair sprouted from her hairless body. As she grew, she developed a soft wavy coat. Appropriately, Linda Koehl named the cat Curly. When Curly matured, Linda Koehl discovered her soft fur felt so inviting to touch that Koehl found herself picking up and cuddling the cat. Not only was Curly’s coat unique, she had such a sweet, gentle, trusting personality that Koehl found herself becoming a bonafide cat lover, quite a leap for someone who previously owned cats only for their efficient, all natural pest control. Curly produced her own litter of five male tabby kittens, all of whom were bald at birth. Like their mother, all soon sprouted coats of curly hair. During the next ten years, Linda Koehl made no attempt to control the breeding or keep track of the curly litters. The curly coat is governed by a dominant gene, which means only one parent need possess the gene in order to produce curly-coated offspring. Because of this, and because the gene pool was relatively small, the number of curly-coated cats grew rapidly. In 1992, ten years after Curly’s birth, Koehl entered four of her curly cats into a CFA show in Portland, Oregon, to see what professional exhibitors and judges had to say. A breed name was required in order to register for the show, so Koehl named Mother Nature’s new creation the LaPerm, since the coat looks like it has a permanent wave. Koehl was astonished by the enthusiastic reception her cats received, and she was completely unprepared when the judges told her the breed was unknown to the cat fancy and should be preserved.  With the help of others, Koehl developed a breeding program and started the long and involved process of gaining recognition for the LaPerm. At this time, the three largest North American associations, ACFA, CFA, and TICA, accept the LaPerm for championship.","Body

60,"The Maine Coon is solid, rugged, and can endure a harsh climate. A distinctive characteristic of this cat is the smooth, shaggy coat. This breed is well-proportioned, has a balanced appearance, and has adapted to varied environments.
",Maine Coon,"No breed has a monopoly on love and affection, but there’s got to be some good reason that Maine Coons have clawed their way up from near extinction to the prized place of America’s second most popular breed (according to the CFA’s registration totals). Maine Coon fans say that the popularity is due to the breed’s large size, intelligence, luxuriant coat, hardy disposition, and devotion to their human family.

Maine Coons are kittens in big cat suits, gentle giants who are playful well into old age, as well as jumbo-sized packages of loving devotion. Maine Coons can also be reserved around people with whom they’re not familiar, probably due to their jumbo-sized brains. Given time, however, even the most cautious adapt. This initial adjustment period is actually a decision-making process; Maine Coons are deciding if these new humans have proven themselves worthy of trust. As soon as they make up their minds, however, they form close bonds with the entire household and become loving and devoted.

Most want to be near you but not on your lap. They are true family members and participate in all family routines, whether watching you channel surf from the comfort of the couch, or following you from room to room. As befits a former seafarer, Maine Coons are fascinated by water, perhaps because their thick coats are water-repellent and won’t become annoyingly soaked as easily as a thinner coat would. Some will join their humans in the shower briefly, or at least walk around on the wet floor after you get out. They prefer to stand on the edge of the tub, however, and touch the water with a curious paw.","Maine Coons, like American Shorthairs, are considered native to America because they’ve been on this continent since the colonial days, and perhaps longer. How they got here in the first place and where their progenitors came from, however, is anyone’s guess, since none of the local colonists happened by with their camera phones to record the event.

Many imaginative stories exist about the origin of the breed (some more believable than others), but hard proof is as elusive as a cat at bath time. One story alleges that the breed is a raccoon/domestic cat hybrid, thus the name Maine Coon. Even though both raccoons and Maine Coons have lush, long tails and the tendency to dunk their food into their drinking water, such a union is biologically impossible. Another anecdote, unlikely but at least possible, holds that the Maine Coon was produced by bobcat/domestic cat trysts, which would explain the ear and toe tufts and the impressive size of the breed. A more imaginative story claims that Maine Coons are descendants of longhaired cats belonging to Marie Antoinette. The Queen’s cats and other belongings were smuggled to America by a captain named Clough, who was preparing to rescue the Queen from her rendezvous with the guillotine. Unfortunately, the Queen lost her head, and the cats ended up staying with Clough in Maine. Last, but not least, is the tale of a sea captain named Coon who, in the 1700s, brought longhaired cats with him on his excursions to America’s northeastern coast. Allegedly, these longhaired buccaneers mixed with the local population while on shore leave.

This last story has at least a ring of truth. Seafarers who used cats to control rodent populations on their sailing ships probably brought some longhaired cats with them to the New World. Some of the cats went ashore when they reached the northeastern coast and established themselves on the farms and in the barns of the early settlers. Given Maine’s severe climate, those initial years must have been tough on cat and human alike. Only the breed’s strongest and most adaptable survived. Through natural selection, the Maine Coon developed into a large, rugged cat with a dense, water-resistant coat and a hardy constitution.

Regardless of where the breed came from, the Maine Coon was one of the first breeds to be recognized by the late nineteenth-century cat fancy, and became an early favorite. However, in the early 1900s, as new and more exotic breeds were brought into the country, Maine Coons were abandoned for Persians, Angoras, and others. By 1950, the breed had all but vanished and in fact was declared extinct in the 1950s.

Fortunately, the announcement of the Maine Coon’s demise was greatly exaggerated, and today these cats have regained their former glory, second only to the Persian in popularity.","Body

51,"The overall impression of the Manx cat is that of roundness; round head with firm, round muzzle and prominent cheeks; broad chest; substantial short front legs; short back which arches from shoulders to a round rump; great depth of flank and rounded, muscular thighs.",Manx ,"The Manx’s personality is probably the reason the breed has won such a strong following despite the physical difficulties. Manx cats make great companions. They are intelligent, fun-loving cats that manage to express themselves very well without tails to swish around. Manx are particularly noted for their strong bonds of devotion and loyalty to their chosen humans and enjoy spending quality time with them, whether it’s sitting beside their humans enjoying quiet time, or racing around the house after a tossed sponge ball or a whirling feather-tufted toy. Manx are exceptional jumpers because of the powerful back legs. If sufficiently motivated, they will find a way into the most secure cupboard. No shelf is safe from the high-flying Manx.

They get along particularly well with other cats and well-behaved dogs and enjoy romps with these compatible companions. Despite their playful temperament, they are usually very gentle. Their playful yet tractable dispositions make them good pets for families with children. They are fascinated by water; perhaps this fascination comes from originating on a small piece of land surrounded by the liquid. However, if you dunk them in the nasty stuff they quickly lose their fascination.","The Manx has existed for many centuries on the Isle of Man, located in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland. Since the Isle did not have an indigenous feline species from which the Manx could develop, it is surmised that domestic cats were introduced by human settlers and explorers. Exactly who and when is uncertain.

One story has it that the cats were aboard a ship of the Spanish Armada that was wrecked on the Isle of Man in 1588. The resourceful cats supposedly swam ashore at Spanish Point and set up mousekeeping on the Isle. Another story claims that the Manx was introduced by Phoenician traders who transported the cats from Japan. Still another says that cats arrived with the Viking settlers who colonized the Isle of Man.

Regardless of how cats got on the Isle, they presumably arrived with their tails intact. Geneticists believe that the Manx’s taillessness is the result of a spontaneous mutation within the Isle’s domestic cat population. Genetically, the Manx and other short tailed domestic felines are quite different. The Manx’s tail, or lack thereof, is governed by a dominant gene, while most other short-tailed breeds, such as the Japanese Bobtail, have tails governed by recessive genes. Given the Isle’s closed environment and small gene pool, the dominant gene easily passed from one generation to the next.

Inhabitants of the Isle, unaware of or unimpressed by boring scientific theory, invented more interesting tales to account for the Manx’s lack. One contends that the Manx is an impossible mix between a cat and a rabbit. Another claims that Irish invaders stole the cats’ tails to use for their helmet plumes. A third says two Manx cats were passengers on Noah’s Ark, but as they were the last to board Noah slammed the door on their tails.

The modern history of the Manx is better documented, if more mundane. The Manx was a well-established and popular breed, supported by an enthusiastic group of Manx owners. King Edward VIII was reportedly a Manx fan and often attended cat shows featuring the breed. The British formed the first Manx club in 1901. The Manx journeyed to America by the 1880s (and probably earlier), as Manx cats are noted in earliest American cat registry records. Manx cats were at first transported from the Isle of Man but, as the demand grew, the supply waned. Today, Manx cats are in great demand because of their rarity, but pets can be found at adoption organizations fairly easily.","Solidly muscled, compact and well-balanced, medium in size with sturdy bone structure. The Manx is stout in appearance with broad chest and well-sprung ribs. The constant repetition of curves and circles give the Manx the appearance of great substance and durability, a cat that is powerful without the slightest hint of coarseness. Flank has greater depth than in other breeds, causing considerable depth to the body when viewed from the side. The short back forms a smooth, continuous arch from shoulders to rump, curving at the rump to form the desirable round look. Length of back is in proportion to the entire cat, height of hindquarters equal to length of body.

Head
Round head with prominent cheeks and a jowly appearance that enhances the round appearance of the breed. In profile, head is medium in length with a gentle dip from forehead to nose. Well-developed muzzle, very slightly longer than it is broad, with a strong chin. Definite whisker break with large, round whisker pads. Short, thick neck.

Ears
Wide at the base, tapering gradually to a rounded tip. Medium in size in proportion to the head, widely spaced and set slightly outward. When viewed from behind, the ear set resembles the rocker on a cradle. The furnishings of the ears are sparse.

Eyes
Large, round and full. Set at a slight angle toward the nose; outer corners slightly higher than inner corners. Color is gold to copper, odd eyed, blue eyed, green, or hazel as appropriate to the coat color.",1,../../../assets/cat-breeds/Mons.png,7,10,8,12,4,3,5,5,3,3,3,4,3,4,0,0,0,0
52,"The Munchkin cat has no problem getting around the same as its longer-limbed feline friends -- it just might take them a few extra steps along the way. These cute, curious cats are known for snatching shiny objects, so don't be surprised if these ""magpies"" borrow your favorite piece of jewelry.
",Munchkin ,"For their part, Munchkins, oblivious to the controversy surrounding them, go on being just what they are—cats—self-assured and outgoing. Shortchanged in the leg department doesn’t mean short on intelligence or personality. Friendly and people-oriented, Munchkins make devoted companions, and they get along well with other cats, dogs, and people. They love to wrestle and play with their long-legged feline friends, happily unaware that there’s anything different about them. Nor do their feline companions treat them as members of the vertically challenged. It’s only humans who look at them askance.

Fanciers assert Munchkins can do anything an ordinary cat can do, except leap to the top of the kitchen counter. Some fanciers consider this a feature, however, instead of a disadvantage. Despite the short legs, Munchkins run fast, bounding like ferrets and taking corners at full speed. To get a better view, they often sit up on their haunches rather like prairie dogs. They can climb cat posts and curtains as well as any cat. However, they can’t jump as high because the shorter back legs don’t provide as much leverage. Munchkins can jump onto most beds, chairs, and couches, but may take a scenic route onto a chair or other lower item before attempting your desk.

Munchkins are also known as magpies, often borrowing small, shiny objects and stashing them away for later play. Proficient hunters, Munchkins love a good game of catnip mouse, but when playtime is over, they want a warm lap to snuggle into and strokes from a loving hand, like any cat.","The cat fancy’s version of downsizing— the Munchkin—has cat fanciers on both sides hissing over whether the breed should be recognized. While most new breeds have to face periods of resistance before acceptance can occur, the battle over this breed has been particularly long and heated because it raises questions regarding where unique variety ends and abomination begins. This point has been previously raised within the cat fancy concerning breeds such as the Sphynx and the Manx, now widely accepted breeds.

Short-legged cats have been documented as early as the 1930s in England. According to records, these short-legged cats survived for four generations before World War II took its toll on the cat population of Europe. One such cat was also reported in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and dubbed the “Stalingrad Kangaroo Cat” for its tendency to sit up on its haunches. But the breed as we know it today began in Louisiana, USA.

In 1983 music teacher Sandra Hochenedel of Rayville, Louisiana discovered two cats hiding under a pickup truck where they had been cornered by a dog. Hochenedel rescued the cats and took them home, later noticing three things—both were female, both were pregnant, and both had short, stubby legs on normal-sized bodies. She kept Blackberry, the black-haired kitty, and gave away Blueberry, the gray-haired cat. What happened to Blueberry is unknown; all of today’s registered Munchkins can be traced back to Blackberry and one of her sons.

When Blackberry had her litter, Hochenedel discovered that Blackberry had given birth to both short and ordinary long-legged kittens. One of the kittens, a handsome male Hochenedel named Toulouse after French painter Toulouse-Lautrec who, due to a bone disease, had an adult-sized torso but child-sized legs. Hochenedel gave Toulouse to Kay LaFrance, a friend who lived in Monroe, Louisiana. Using Toulouse, LaFrance established her own colony of Munchkins on her Louisiana plantation. Since LaFrance’s cats were allowed free access to the outdoors and were not altered, a semi-feral population of Munchkins developed around Monroe, where they competed very well with their long-legged friends for prey and mating opportunities. Blackberry vanished after having only a few litters, but her genetic legacy continued. Since LaFrance allowed Blackberry’s son, Toulouse, to wander around unaltered, in short order a good sized population of short-legged cats lived on LaFrance’s property. Since cats in heat care little about their partners’ leg length (or much of anything else), Toulouse and his short-legged offspring had no trouble competing for mates with their longer-legged rivals.

Hochenedel and LaFrance, seeing how well the cats were doing on their own, thought this might be the beginning of a new breed. They named the breed after the little people of Munchkinland from the classic 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, and contacted Dr. Solveig Pflueger, M.D., Ph.D., allbreed judge and TICA’s genetics committee chair. Dr. Pflueger conducted a study to assess the inheritance and expression of the Munchkin’s short legs. She found that an autosomal dominant gene (a dominant gene residing on a chromosome that’s not a sex chromosome) caused the long bones of the legs to be shorter than usual, and that the mutation had apparently occurred spontaneously within the feline gene pool. Concerned that these cats would have spinal dysfunction, degenerative disc disease, or hip dysplasia like the short-legged Dachshund, Corgi, and Basset Hound dog breeds, the breeders had the spines of a number of Munchkins examined and X-rayed by David Biller, D.V.M, head of radiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University. No problems were discovered, but at the time the breed was so new and bloodlines so limited that the studies were not considered definitive. Independently, breeders had their oldest Munchkins X-rayed and examined for signs of joint or bone problems. No problems were found, but opponents pointed out that absence of proof wasn’t proof of absence, since the oldest Munchkin was only about thirteen years old at that time, and the others X-rayed were younger still.

Hochenedel and LaFrance wrote the first breed standard, and established a breeding program. Other breeders soon joined their cause and established their own Munchkin breeding programs. In 1991, the Munchkin was introduced to the public at the nationally televised INCATS TICA show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, to both acclaim and resistance. They tried to gain recognition for the Munchkin with TICA at that time, but were turned down on the basis that not enough was known about the breed. In 1994, the Munchkin breeders tried again, and this time the breed was accepted into TICA’s New Breed development program in September of that year. TICA’s New Breed development program is overseen by TICA’s genetics committee, which tracks the pedigrees and monitors the breeding statistics as a breed develops, including the outcrosses used to develop the breed. This program confirmed that the gene governing the short legs was dominant; any cat that possesses the gene will have the foreshortened legs, and can pass along the trait to its offspring. As of May 1, 1995, the Munchkin was recognized for New Breed and Color (NBC) status in TICA.

When the acceptance was announced, one of the long-time TICA members resigned her ten-year judging position, saying the breed was an affront to any breeder with ethics. Others shared her sentiments, feeling that the short legs would cause crippling back, hip, and leg problems in the future, although no evidence existed that the Munchkin is prone to such problems. However, other judges and fanciers were more tolerant or open-minded, and many cat lovers were enthusiastic about the new breed. Negative attitudes toward Munchkins are more frequent within the cat fancy than from the general public, say breeders. Ironically, the controversy surrounding the breed contributed to its growing popularity. Because of articles in The Wall Street Journal, People, and other publications, demand for the sports car of the cat fancy increased until breeders had trouble meeting the demand. Waiting lists were long, and the supply limited. The sports car of the cat fancy commanded sports car prices, too, and breeders were concerned that unscrupulous people would take advantage of the Munchkin’s popularity and use unethical backyard breeding practices.

After years of development and controversy, the Munchkin achieved TICA championship status in May 2003. Today, the breed is accepted for championship in AACE, TICA, and UFO in both long and short hair, but as of yet have not been able to receive recognition in ACFA, CCA, CFF, and CFA. The Munchkin has been accepted by some associations in other countries as well, such as the Waratah National Cat Alliance in Australia, the United Feline Organization in the United Kingdom, and the Southern Africa Cat Council in South Africa. Other associations have refused to accept the breed; the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) added to their rules they won’t recognize any breed “showing as a breed characteristic a dominant gene resulting in shortened limbs and legs and other physical defects, for example, the Munchkin.” The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) released a statement in 1991 that it “will strongly discourage anyone from importing such a cat [as the Munchkin] and that there was no intention of recognizing this or any other new breed which was based on abnormal structure or development.” To keep the breed healthy and to widen the still relatively small gene pool, outcrossing to long-legged domestic longhairs and shorthairs that are not members of recognized breeds will continue in the future. Because of this, the body and head conformation, as well as color, pattern, hair length, and coat type, may vary as new genes are introduced.","Body

53,"Nebelung cats look similar to the Russian Blue, but they are two separate breeds. The Nebulung is recognizable by its thick, shimmering blue coat and adored for its sweet, affectionate personality. Make sure you have plenty of time to spend with this loyal cat.
",Nebelung,"The best thing about Nebelungs is their personality. Affectionate, sweet, and loving, Nebelungs form close bonds of love and trust with their human companions and stay extremely devoted and loyal their entire lives.

Nebelungs are playful, affectionate, and intelligent, and follow their favorite humans from room to room to keep an eye on the action. Sit down, and your lap will quickly be filled by silky soft fur; Nebelungs enjoy sitting beside or in the laps of their chosen humans to receive their due of petting and pampering. They tend to bond with a select few humans and stay loving and dedicated throughout their lives.

This breed likes a steady routine, will learn yours quickly, and dislike disruptions to their habits; Nebelungs need time to adjust to household changes. They tend to adapt slowly to changes in their routines or the routines of their humans; if you go back to working full time after being at home for many months, Nebelungs may have trouble adjusting. It’s important to make sure that your Nebelung gets plenty of love and attention during times of change. If you must leave a Nebelung alone for long hours, provide a compatible cat companion to keep your Nebelung company while you’re away earning the cat food. Early socializing can help your Nebelung adapt more easily. They are soft-spoken unless something is seriously wrong, such as empty food dishes or cat boxes that are not up to the Nebelung standard of cleanliness. This breed tends to be particular about their environment, and will make their feelings known about litter boxes that offend their sensitive noses or cuisine that doesn’t meet their high standards.

Nebelungs are generally reserved around strangers, ranging from hiding-under-the-bed timid to warily eyeing intruders from a safe distance. Given the sometimes unpredictable behavior of some humans, this could be interpreted as a sign of this breed’s extreme intelligence. To their chosen family, however, Nebelungs are affectionate and playful.","The Nebelung (NAY-bel-ung) breed began the way so many of our breeds began—a stray cat wandered out of the mist and developed into a unique new breed. This breed’s saga began in the early 1980s, when a shorthaired black female feline and her black longhaired Angora-type suitor produced a litter of three. One of the shorthaired black females was given to the son of computer programmer Cora Cobb of Denver, Colorado, who named the kitten Elsa.

In August 1984, Elsa produced a litter of her own, with the help of a shorthaired Russian Blue-type tomcat. Both Elsa and her blue-haired boyfriend must have possessed the recessive gene for long hair, because Elsa’s litter of six included one beautiful longhaired solid blue male. Quite taken with the handsome blue fuzz ball, Cora Cobb adopted the kitten and named him Siegfried after the hero in her favorite Wagner opera, The Ring of the Nibelung. As Siegfried grew, Cobb was taken by Siegfried’s beauty and devoted personality— he was the most loving, devoted cat she’d ever known. When Elsa’s next litter, fathered by the same Russian Blue-type tom, produced a lovely longhaired female kitten that possessed many of Siegfried’s delightful characteristics, Cobb obtained her and named her Brunhilde, after the heroine in Wagner’s opera. The blue female was beautiful and sweet, and her silky hair was longer and lighter than Siegfried’s. Now that Cobb had a matching set of these loving and beautiful blue cats, she decided to see if she could preserve their beauty and loving temperament by breeding brother to sister. If she could produce cats as extraordinary and beautiful as these two, Cobb thought, everyone would want one.

When Cobb moved to El Paso, Texas, in 1985, she took Siegfried and Brunhilde with her. In 1986, Brunhilde accepted her brother as mate, and about two months later she produced a litter of three blue longhairs. To Cobb’s delight, all three inherited Siegfried’s Russian Blue body type and Brunhilde’s longer, glossy blue fur. Since Cobb was unfamiliar with the genetics of breeding cats, she didn’t know that blue, longhaired kittens were the only possible outcome of Siegfried’s and Brunhilde’s rendezvous. Both long hair and blue coloration are governed by recessive genes; to express those traits in their physical appearance each had to possess two copies of each gene. Since both Siegfried’s and Brunhilde had solid blue coloration and long hair, all offspring would have both traits as well.

Cobb named the breed the Nebelung, a German word that loosely means “creatures of the mist,” an appropriate name for a feline that magically vanishes into thin air when strangers come to visit. She decided to see what it would take to establish her new breed of cat. On the advice of TICA’s genetics chairperson, Dr. Solveig Pflueger, to whom Cobb turned for guidance in establishing her new breed, Cobb wrote the Nebelung’s standard almost word for word from the Russian Blue’s, except for the coat length and the general opening description. TICA accepted the Nebelung for registration in September 1987.

The Nebelung has appeared twice on the front cover of a Japanese cat magazine, and Nebelungs were shown at the 1989 TICA cat show in Paris, France. As of May 1, 1997, the Nebelung was granted championship status in TICA, a major step forward that brought the breed national and international attention. Today, Nebelungs are recognized by ACFA, CFF, and TICA, as well as the international associations the World Cat Federation (WCF), and Livre Officiel des Origines Félines (LOOF).","Body

54,"The Norwegian Forest Cat is a sturdy cat with a distinguishing double coat and easily recognizable body shape. This is a slow maturing breed, attaining full growth at approximately five years of age.
",Norwegian Forest,"Natural athletes, Norwegian Forest Cats love to investigate counters, bookcases, and the loftiest peaks of their cat trees. Wegies are active and playful and retain their fun-loving spirit well into adulthood, but don’t be fooled by the breed’s impressive muscles and all-weather exterior. They are sweet, friendly, and family-oriented, and they love their human companions.

Despite the wild years in the forests of Norway—or perhaps because of it—they would much rather cuddle than prowl. Perhaps, because of years spent in Norway’s harsh climate, nothing fazes them much, either. They take new people and new situations in stride; as cats go, Forest Cats are the strong, silent types. They are conversely great purrers, particularly when perched beside their favorite humans. Outgoing and gregarious, they tend not to bond with one person, but rather love everyone unconditionally and enthusiastically.","The Norwegian Forest Cat, called the skogkatt (forest cat) in Norway, is a natural breed and despite a feral appearance is not a descendant or a hybrid of any wild cat species. Forest Cats probably arrived in Norway from Europe, descendants of domestic cats introduced to northern Europe by the Romans.

It is supposed that the Norwegian Forest Cat has existed for a long time, since several mentions of large, longhaired cats exist in Norse mythology. Estimates of when these cat tales were written vary greatly. Most Norse myths were passed down by oral tradition and were finally recorded in what was called the Edda poems, written sometime between 800 c.e. and 1200 c.e. These myths suggest that domestic cats have been in Norway for hundreds, possibly thousands, of years. Whether the cats portrayed in the myths are Forest Cats is subject to debate.

When cats arrived in the northern countries, most likely with human settlers, traders, or crusaders, the breed’s ancestors were probably shorthaired, since the cats transported by the Romans came from Egypt (generally) and were shorthaired varieties. The cats survived and in time adapted to the severe climate. Northern Norway, where the sun never sets from May 12 to August 1, and where the winter nights are correspondingly long and dark, proved a harsh test for these cats. Over the centuries of prowling the Norwegian forests, they developed long, dense, water-resistant coats, hardy constitutions, quick wits, and well-honed survival instincts.

The first efforts to have the Forest Cat recognized as a distinct breed began in the 1930s. However, after World War II, the breed came close to extinction. It wasn’t until the 1970s that the cat fans in Norway began working to preserve the Norwegian Forest Cat.

Wegies (as Norwegian Forest Cats are affectionately known) arrived in the United States in 1980. TICA, the first to recognize the breed, accepted the Norwegian Forest Cat for championship competition in 1984. The breed attained CFA championship status in 1993.","Body
Solidly muscled and well-balanced, moderate in length, substantial bone structure, with powerful appearance showing a broad chest and considerable girth without being fat. Flank has great depth. Males may be large and imposing; females may be more refined and smaller.

Head
Equilateral triangle, where all sides are of equal length as measured from the outside of the base of the ear to the point of the chin. The neck is short and heavily muscled. Nose is straight from the brow ridge to the tip of the nose without a break in the line. The flat forehead continues into a gentle curved skull and neck. Chin is firm and should be in line with the front of the nose. It is gently rounded in profile. Muzzle is part of the straight line extending toward the base of ear without pronounced whisker pads and without pinch.

Ears
Medium to large, rounded at the tip, broad at base, set as much on the side of the head as on top of the head, alert, with the cup of the ear pointing a bit sideways. The outsides of the ears follow the lines from the side of the head down to the chin. The ears are heavily furnished.

Eyes
Large, almond shaped, well-opened, and expressive, set at a slight angle with the outer corner higher than the inner corner. Eye color is typically shades of green, gold, green-gold, or copper. White cats and cats with white may have blue or odd eyes.

Legs & Paws
Medium, with hind legs longer than front legs, making the rump higher than the shoulders. Thighs are heavily muscled; lower legs are substantial. When viewed from the rear, back legs are straight. When viewed from the front the paws appear to be “toe out.” Large round, firm paws with heavy tufting between toes.

Tail
Long and bushy. Broader at the base. The length is usually equal to the body from the base of tail to the base of neck. May have guard hairs.

Coat
Distinguishing double coat, consisting of a dense undercoat, covered by long, glossy, and smooth water-resistant guard hairs hanging down the sides. The bib consists of three separate sections: short collar at neck, side mutton chops, and frontal ruff. Britches are full on the hind legs. The coat may be fuller in the winter than the summer because the dense undercoat has its full development in the winter. Softer coats may be found in shaded, solid, and bi-color cats.

Color
Every color and pattern is possible with the exception of those showing hybridization resulting in the colors chocolate, sable, lavender, lilac, cinnamon, fawn, point-restricted (Himalayan type markings), or these colors with white. Color and pattern is often clear and distinct. In the case of the classic, mackerel, and spotted tabbies the pattern should be well-marked and even.",1,../../../assets/cat-breeds/Norwegian.png,9,12,8,18,4,3,4,4,1,4,3,3,4,3,4,0,0,0
55,"The Ocicat is a medium to large, well-spotted agouti cat of moderate type. This breed displays the look of an athletic animal: well-muscled and solid, graceful and lithe, yet with a fullness of body and chest. This powerful, athletic, yet graceful spotted cat is particularly noted for having a “wild” appearance.
",Ocicat ,"Ocicats may look like they walk on the wild side, but they are affectionate, adaptable, curious, and playful, and possess strong devotion to their human companions. Highly intelligent, active, and social, Ocicats quickly learn to respond to their names and can be taught a variety of tricks, including coming on command. Begging for food is another trick that Ocicats master with very little prompting.

The Ocicat personality is active, affectionate, and very social and adaptable. Ocicats tend to bond with only one person and prefer that person’s company to all others, although they are friendly and affectionate to others in the household. They get along well with other animals and people, and appreciate an animal companion to keep them company if left alone for any length of time.

Like their Abyssinian ancestors, Ocicats love to perform daring tap dances on top of your bookcases for your amusement. They are an active breed and require a good deal of space and plenty of toys and diversions to keep them occupied. Like their Siamese ancestors, Ocicats are vocal, but not annoyingly so. They want to tell you about their day when you come home at night, but they won’t bore you with every detail. In addition, their voices lack the Siamese rasp that some people find annoying. However, because they are a vocal breed, they are highly tuned to tone of voice, and harsh verbal reprimands can hurt their sensitive feelings, or even damage the trust they’ve placed in their favored humans.","Dalai Dotson, an Abyssinian-Siamese mix, is considered the first of the Ocicat breed. The name Ocicat came about because this cat is reminiscent of the spotted wild cat called the ocelot. 1966, CFA accepted the Ocicat for registration status, and Dalai Dotson was registered with CFA. In the minutes of the CFA annual meeting recognizing the Ocicat for registration, the breed was mistakenly described as a mix between the Abyssinian and the American Shorthair. When the error was brought to their attention, Siamese was added to the wording, without removing American Shorthair from the list. This error turned out to be a happy accident for the Ocicat; the American Shorthair influence also added size and musculature to a breed that originally resembled the lithe Abyssinian and the svelte Siamese.

In the 1980’s, the word got around about the beauty and personality of the breed, and many more individuals joined the Ocicat fan club. In May of 1986, the Ocicat attained CFA provisional status, and only one year later was granted championship status. TICA granted championship in 1987 as well. Today, all North American cat associations recognize the Ocicat for championship. The breed has gained in popularity and has a strong followin","Physical Attributes
Body
Solid, hard, rather long-bodied with depth and fullness but never coarse. The Ocicat is a medium to large cat with substantial bone and muscle development, yet with an athletic appearance, and should have surprising weight for the size. There is often some depth of chest with ribs slightly sprung, the back is level to slightly higher in the rear, and the flank reasonably level. Many Ocicats are athletic, powerful, and lithe. It should be noted that females are generally smaller than males.

Head
The skull is a modified wedge showing a slight curve from muzzle to cheek, with a visible, but gentle, rise from the bridge of the nose to the brow. The muzzle is broad and well defined with a suggestion of squareness and in profile shows good length. The chin is strong, and the jaw is firm with a proper bite. The moderate whisker pinch is not too severe. The head is carried gracefully on an arching neck. An allowance is made for jowls on mature males.

Ears
Alert, moderately large, and set so as to corner the upper, outside dimensions of the head. If an imaginary horizontal line is drawn across the brow, the ears are usually set at a 45 degree angle, i.e., neither too high nor too low. Ear tufts extending vertically from the tips of the ears sometimes occur.

Eyes
Large, almond shaped, and angling slightly upwards toward the ears with more than the length of an eye between the eyes. Ocicats come in all colors except blue. There is no correspondence between eye color and coat color.

Legs & Paws
Legs should be of good substance and well-muscled, medium-long, powerful, and in good proportion to the body. Feet are oval and compact with five toes in front and four in back, with size in proportion to legs.

Tail
Fairly long, medium slim with only a slight taper and with a dark tip.

Coat
Texture short, smooth, and satiny with a lustrous sheen. Tight, close lying, and sleek, yet long enough to accommodate the necessary bands of color. No suggestion of woolliness. All hairs except the tip of the tail are banded. Within the markings, hairs are tipped with a darker color, while hairs in the ground color are tipped with a lighter color.

Color
Tawny spotted, cinnamon spotted, chocolate spotted, blue spotted, fawn spotted, lavender spotted, ebony silver spotted, cinnamon silver spotted, chocolate silver spotted, blue silver spotted, fawn silver spotted, lavender silver spotted. Color is usually clear and pleasing. The lightest color is usually found on the face around the eyes, and on the chin and lower jaw. The darkest color is found on the tip of the tail. distinctive markings can be clearly seen from any orientation. Those on the face, legs, and tail may be darker than those on the torso. Ground color may be darker on the saddle and lighter on the underside, chin, and lower jaw.

56,"The Oriental is a svelte cat with long, tapering lines, very lithe but muscular. Excellent physical condition. Eyes clear. Strong and lithe, neither bony nor flabby. Because of the longer coat, the Longhair Division appears to have softer lines and less extreme type than the Shorthair Division.Oriental Short Hairs
",Oriental Short Hair,"The personality of the Oriental is as distinctive as the multicolored exterior. They are natural entertainers, full of enthusiasm, energy, and the belief that the world should revolve around them. Haughty and royal one minute, they are animated and inquisitive the next. They are highly curious, and will go to great lengths to be involved in your activities. This is not the breed for you if you work all day and have an active night life. The Oriental shouldn’t be left alone for long periods and need other cats as playmates and company for those times you can’t be with them. The Oriental craves attention; this breed needs quality time with their preferred persons. They have a real need for play, and retain that need well into adulthood. It’s wise to have lots of toys for your Oriental, or they will create their own, sometimes out of household items you’d rather they didn’t.

Orientals are extremely social, loving, and loyal, and their feelings are easily hurt if you ignore or scold them. Orientals don’t just want attention— they need it desperately if they are to live happy, healthy lives. If you provide the tender loving care they need, they’ll do just about anything to please you. Ignore them, and they become unhappy and depressed. However, when given their full share of affection, Orientals will repay you with a lifetime of love, affection, and intelligent conversation.

They usually bond with one person and become extremely devoted to and dependent upon their chosen human. Expect them to be at your side, on your shoulder, and at the door to interrogate you about where you’ve been, why you went there, and what you brought back for “me-orrr.” The breed is just as vocal as the Siamese, but range, frequency, and inflection can vary from cat to cat, and bloodline to bloodline. However, like their Siamese relatives, they are never at a loss for words on any subject.","In the past, so the story goes, blue-eyed, pointed pattern cats were owned by royalty and were kept in the Royal Palace of Siam. The Siamese breed, however, is only one of several varieties native to the area. The Cat-Book Poems, a manuscript of verses and paintings written in the city of Ayutthaya, Siam, some time between 1350 c.e. when the kingdom was founded and 1767 c.e. when the city was destroyed by invaders, describes and shows a variety of cats native to the area. These include solid black cats, black-and-white bicolor, solid brown, and solid blue, as well as cats bearing the point-restricted color pattern. The point-restricted cats portrayed in the book had slim bodies and legs, large ears, and tapered muzzles, similar to today’s Siamese and related breeds.

The first cats brought to England from Thailand were often solid brown or solid blue, or black-and-white bicolor, as well as colorpointed. These blue, brown, and bicolor cats were becoming very popular in Europe in the 1890s. However, in the 1920s, the blue-eyed pointed pattern cat became the Siamese norm in Britain, and interest in the other varieties dwindled.

The Oriental of today does not come directly from Thailand, but rather a Siamese hybrid mixed in the 1950s and 1960s. The breed’s creation was deliberate—breeders with a flair for exterior decorating set out to create a cat breed that looked and acted like the Siamese but were lavishly adorned in a wide range of colors and patterns. In the 1950s, British breeders crossed Siamese cats with domestic shorthairs and Russian Blues. In the late 1960s American breeders, fascinated by the British Orientals, took up the torch and crossed Siamese, domestic shorthairs, and Abyssinians to create a new look. Body style was not sacrificed for color and pattern, and backcrosses to the Siamese preserved type and personality traits. The Oriental breeders met with initial hissing and spitting from Siamese breeders who were resistant at best to the idea of another Siamese-type hybrid, but, since the way had already been paved by breeders of the Colorpoint Shorthair, which gained CFA acceptance in 1964, the opposition didn’t stop Orientals from gaining ground.

Orientals became popular very quickly, and demand rose for the shorthairs (at first). In 1972, CFA accepted the Oriental Shorthair for registration, and granted full championship status in 1977. Since then, the Oriental Shorthair rapidly increased in popularity, and has speedily become one of the most popular shorthaired breeds.

The Oriental Longhair came from Oriental Shorthairs; resulting in a cat that had the same wide range of colors and patterns as the Shorthair but with a semi-long coat like the Balinese. Since the Siamese and the Colorpoint had the longhaired Balinese, it seemed only fair that the Oriental Shorthair should have its own longhaired variant—a breed with a long, lean, classy chassis, silky fur, and a full palette of colors and patterns from which to choose. The Oriental Longhair was developed in the late 1970s by mixing the Oriental Shorthair with the Balinese. The breed achieved official recognition in 1985 when TICA accepted them for championship status, and they were accepted for registration by the CFA in February 1988. The breed grew in popularity, appealing to cat lovers who want the elegant body type and personality of the Siamese, the wash-and-wear hairdo of the Balinese, and the myriad colors and patterns of the Oriental Shorthair.

In 1995, the Oriental Shorthair and the Oriental Longhair became a single breed called the Oriental. A new color class for the Oriental— bicolor—also became more widely accepted.","Body

57,"The Persian is a heavily boned, well-balanced cat with a sweet expression and soft, round lines. This cat has large round eyes set wide apart in a large round head. The long thick coat softens the lines of the cat and accentuates the roundness in appearance.
",Persian ,"If you want your cats bouncing around like hyperactive popcorn, don’t adopt a Persian. Persians are perfect companions, if you like placid, sweet-tempered cats. Don’t count on using your Persian pal as a furry doorstop, however. They love to play between periods of regal lounging on your favorite davenport. Proponents say that Persians do not deserve their furniture-with-fur reputation; they are intelligent, just not as inquisitive as some breeds, and not as active.

Persians are devoted to their humans, but can be selective in conferring that honor. You must earn their trust and love. They crave affection and love to be petted and fussed over, but won’t harass you for attention the way some breeds will. They will, however, let their feelings be known if they are not getting the requisite amount of attention.

Persians require significant time commitment. That beautiful coat requires daily grooming to keep it in good condition and free of mats. Many Persians require professional grooming.","Persians have enjoyed a long reign as a favorite breed and have featured prominently since 1871. Persians have been around for much longer than 125 years. Longhaired cats, including the ancestors of the modern Persian and Angora breeds, were first seen in Europe in the mid-to-late 1500s, introduced by Roman and Phoenician caravans from Persia (now Iran) and Turkey, according to documents of the era. Researchers believe the recessive gene for long hair appeared spontaneously via mutation in the cat population in the cold mountainous areas of Persia.

An Italian traveler by the name of Pietro della Valle (1586–1652) is credited with bringing Persian cats to the European world in the 1600s. Both Angora and Persian cats are mentioned in the manuscript Voyages de Pietro della Valle. He described the Persians as gray with very long, silky, glossy fur. He noted that the cats resided in the province of Khorazan in Persia, and that they came from India with the Portuguese.

Other travelers brought Persian and Angora cats into France and then into England, causing them to be called “French cats” for a number of years. These cats quickly became popular in Britain. During this time and for centuries after, the Turkish Angora and Persian varieties (among others) were commonly mixed. At first, Angoras were preferred for their silky white coats. Eventually, however, the British came to favor the stockier version. By 1871, distinct differences between the Persian and the Angora could be seen, the former being stockier with small, rounded ears, and the latter being slender and tall eared.

By the early 1900s, the Persian had become overwhelmingly popular. Blue Persians were particularly prized, probably because Queen Victoria was the proud pet parent of two. In the early 1900s, it was decided that the Persian, as well as the Angora and Russian Longhairs, would be known simply as Longhairs, a policy that continues today. Each color is considered a separate breed in Britain.

Persians were brought to America in the late 1800s, where they were enthusiastically received. The Persian quickly shoved aside the competition and quickly took the place as the top cat. The American Persian developed a unique style and evolved into the type we see today. They are by far the most popular pedigreed breed in the North America. In North America, the Persian is considered one breed, regardless of color. Colors and patterns are divisions within the breed.","Body

",Pixiebob ,"The Pixiebob’s wild look does not reflect the breed’s personality, which is loving, trustworthy, and tractable. While Pixiebobs vary in temperament depending upon their bloodlines and mixes, most are intelligent, social, people-oriented, and curious and playful. Some tend to be more laidback with sweet and devoted personalities. Pixiebobs are intelligent, bonds well with their family, and are playful without being destructive.

Pixiebobs tend to get along well with both children and other pets. They can be leash trained easily, and love to take walks with their humans. In general, Pixiebobs become attached to the entire family and get along well with everyone. They usually don’t bond with one special person. Some Pixiebobs are sociable with people outside the family as well, while others love their families but hide under the bed when strangers come to call. Most Pixiebobs like to be close to their human families, and follow their pet parents around the house. They also enjoy children who play nicely, and usually get along well and enjoy playing with other cat-friendly companion animals, as long as the proper introductions are made.

Most are quiet; their vocalization is usually limited to chirps and twitters, although they will meow occasionally when they have something essential to say to their favorite humans. Some will have conversations with their people in quiet meows. Pixiebobs are highly intelligent and quickly learn the meaning of useful words and phrases.","Conflicting stories exist about the origin of this breed. A common legend is that Pixiebobs trace their roots to American bobcats. In actuality, this breed is simply a domestic cat with a tail mutation.

Carol Ann Brewer of Stoneisland Cattery in Washington State is credited with the origination of the Pixiebob breed. In April 1986, the foundation female was born to a bobbed tail classic tabby male that reportedly stood as tall as the knees, and a domestic female cat. The kitten had a reddish-fawn coat with subdued spotting and a face with a wild appearance, although the cat was domestic in temperament. Brewer named her Pixie. In 1987, Brewer began looking for more bobtailed cats with the distinctive wild appearance. She wanted more cats like Pixie.

In 1989 she wrote the first breed standard, which included the consistently reproduced traits of these bobtailed cats, and named the breed the Pixiebob, in honor of Pixie and because of the defining bobbed tail trait of the breed. When Brewer began seeking association acceptance for the breed, she discovered how difficult it would be to register an assumed wildcat hybrid, even though this actually wasn’t true for the Pixiebob; CFA doesn’t accept any breeds with wildcat blood, not even the popular Bengal. In 1993, Brewer approached TICA and submitted the first standard in preparation to begin the process of recognition for the breed. The breed was presented to TICA as a purely domestic breed and DNA testing for wildcat markers revealed that the cats tested possessed none. No proof existed that the Pixiebob was anything but a short-tailed domestic cat. In 1998, the Pixiebob achieved TICA championship status.

Pixiebobs can have tails of varying lengths, and some have ordinary long tails. The tail is unlike the Manx tail types; Pixiebobs are not born completely tailless like the Manx, although rarely a tail will be so short that the cat appears tailless.","Body

The first cat of this breed, Josephine, was a semi-feral solid white Turkish Angora-type cat that resided in Riverside, California. One of her kittens, a mitted seal point longhair with a white blaze and a white tail tip named Daddy Warbucks, went on to become one of the foundation males of the breed. The cats that had the pointed pattern and mitted feet were called Cherubim, but others came in a variety of solid and bi-color patterns. The non-pointed and non-mitted cats were called Miracle Ragdolls. The name Ragdoll was trademarked in 1971 by the breed’s founder, but in 1975, some individuals split from the founder’s Ragdoll association, naming their new breed RagaMuffin instead.The RagaMuffin was represented as a new breed, not as a new Ragdoll color division, and therefore had to go through each phase of acceptance and meet each association’s requirements as a new breed. However, they persisted, and today all associations except CCA recognize the RagaMuffin, although TICA has yet to accept the breed beyond registration status.

The RagaMuffin has a solid base of fans who believe the breed is the cat’s meow. The RagaMuffin is similar, but not identical, to the Ragdoll because of the many years of separation between the two breeds. The RagaMuffin comes in a wider variety of colors, and the body type is slightly different.","Body
Rectangular, broad chest and broad shoulders, and moderately heavy muscling in the hindquarters with the hindquarters being equally as broad as the shoulders. There is a fatty pad in the lower abdomen. These cats are fully fleshed and upon palpation should feel well covered with flesh. The cat has an overall balance in body size, shape, and distribution of weight.

Head
Broad modified wedge with a rounded appearance. The forehead should be moderately rounded. Muzzle is round, slightly shorter than moderate in length, tending to broadness. The chin is firmly rounded, reflecting a proper bite. There is puffiness to the whisker pad, which results in the characteristic “sweet look” of the RagaMuffin. Cheeks are full. In profile, there is an obvious nose dip, giving the impression of a scoop rather than a break. Neck is short, heavy, and strong.

Ears
Medium in size, set as much on the side of the head as on the top of the head with slight flaring, tilted slightly forward. Ears are rounded with moderate furnishings, in pleasing proportion to the head.

Eyes
Large, walnut shaped and expressive, moderately wide set, the eyes contribute to the characteristic sweet look. A slight oriental slant to the eye. The more intense the eye color, the better. All eye colors can be found, including odd eyed, aqua, and yellow/gold.

Legs & Paws
Legs are heavily boned, medium in length with the back legs slightly longer than the front legs, yet in proportion to the body. The paws are large and round, able to support the weight of the cat without splaying, and with tufts beneath and between the paws.

Tail
Long, in proportion to the body. The tail is fully furred, similar in look to a plume or soft bottle brush, medium at the base with a slight taper.

Coat
Fur is medium to medium-long. Texture is soft, dense, and silky. Texture will vary slightly with color. Fur length is slightly longer around neck and outer edges of face, resulting in the appearance of a ruff, and increasing in length from top of head down through shoulder blades and back, with the coat on the sides and stomach being medium to medium-long. The fur on the front legs is thick and short to medium in length. The fur on the hind legs is medium to medium-long and thick with the appearance of a wispy frill on the hindquarters.

Color
Every genetically possible color and pattern with or without white, except pointed colors. Any amount of white is allowed, e.g., white spots on paws, back, chest, or belly; blaze, locket, etc. The pattern or the white spotting may have any degree of symmetry. Nose leather and paw pads come in all colors and in any color combination, not necessarily related to coat color. Cats with white on feet may have pink paw pads or they may be bi-colored or multi-colored.",1,../../../assets/cat-breeds/Ragamuffin.png,9,11,10,20,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,4,2,4,0,0,0,0
60,"The Ragdoll is a well-balanced cat with no extreme features. They are a medium to large, moderately longhaired, blue-eyed pointed cats. The point markings may be covered by a range of white overlay patterns. Ragdolls are slow maturing, reaching full coat and color at about three years of age. The Ragdoll is an affectionate and intelligent cat, giving the impression of graceful movement and subdued power, striking in appearance.
",Ragdoll,"Docile, mild-mannered, and congenial, Ragdolls make ideal indoor companions. One of the nicest features of these cats is their laid-back, sweet personality. They are devotion wrapped in silky fur, loving loyalty with gentle white paws. Very in tune with their human’s routines and emotions, Ragdolls are there when you come home at night to greet you with a leg rub, a forehead kiss, and a big purr. If you’ve had a bad day, they’ll cuddle into your lap to offer gentle comfort so that soon you’ll be smiling again. A better friend you couldn’t have.

They are playful but are not overactive. Known to adapt easily to almost any environment, Ragdolls get along well with children and adults, as well as other cats and dogs. They are easily trained to stay off the counter and are affectionate without being overly demanding. They have soft, polite voices, even at dinnertime, even though they are renowned for their enthusiasm for food. One thing Ragdolls are not, however, is impervious to pain. If you accidentally step on their tails, they’ll shriek and eye you reproachfully, just as any other cat will.","The Ragdoll is a breed whose origins are surrounded by mystery, controversy, and tall tales. Instead of facts, we have colorful stories, speculation, conjecture, and plain old fiction. Telling one from the other is easier said than done. The Ragdoll was developed in the 1960s by the late Ann Baker of Riverside, California. In fact, who, where, and when are just about the only details involving the breed’s origins that are not subject to debate. The foundation cat from which the breed originated, Josephine, was a semi-feral longhaired white female of unknown parentage. Despite Ann Baker’s colorful stories, it’s likely that the foundation cat possessed some exceptional genes, either recessive or masked by her dominant white color, allowing for some striking offspring. These striking offspring, in particular a mitted sealpoint longhaired male with a white blaze and a white tail tip named Daddy Warbucks, became the foundation of the Ragdoll breed.

In 1971, Ann Baker trademarked the name Ragdoll, and after years of selective breeding, the Ragdoll developed into the breed known today. It took many years of effort to overcome the strange tales and controversies behind the breed, but with the Ragdoll’s hard-won CFA championship status granted in February 2000, the breed was finally recognized for championship by every major North American cat association. The Ragdoll has earned a place in the spotlight, just as this cat has earned a place in the laps and hearts of people everywhere.","Body

61,"The Russian Blue cat is recognizable by his beautiful green eyes and a striking blue coat that has a lustrous sheen.
",Russian Blue,"Russian Blues are known to be quiet, gentle, genteel cats, and are usually reserved or absent when strangers come to call. When they’re with their own beloved and trusted humans, however, they are playful and affectionate. Russian Blues are active but not overly so. They like nothing better than to spend time pouncing on a favorite toy or chasing sunbeams. They willingly entertain themselves, but prefer games in which their preferred people take an active role. When you’re home, they follow you around, unobtrusive but ever-present companions.

The slight upturn to the corners of the mouth make Russian Blues appear to be forever smiling. Members of this breed are generally polite, quiet, and well-behaved, for cats. It’s quite easy to teach them to stay off counters and out of off-limit areas; usually a simple “No” will do. However, Russian Blues seem to think politeness should go both ways and take offense at being made to look silly. A dignified cat, Russian Blues can be trusted to know when you’re making fun of them—and they won’t soon forget this breach in manners, either.

Russian Blues like their daily routine to be just so, and dislike household changes more than the average cat— and the average cat dislikes household changes a lot. They particularly dislike changes to their dinner schedule, and will make you aware of their displeasure. They are also fastidious about their litter boxes and will complain or may even go elsewhere if they’re not spic and span.","The most commonly held theory regarding this breed’s origin is that Russian Blues were brought to Great Britain in 1860 by British sailors from the White Sea port town of Archangel (Arkhangelsk) in northern Russia. Whether this story is true—and if true, whether the cats really originated in that area—is anyone’s guess. Their thick coats give credence to the theory that they developed in a cold climate, and, according to accounts, blue shorthairs still exist in Russia.

The Russian Blue is not believed to be related to the other three shorthaired solid blue breeds: Thailand’s Korat, France’s Chartreux, and Britain’s British Blue (now called the British Shorthair). The four breeds have distinct differences in coat type, conformation, and personality, although the Korat, Chartreux, and Russian Blue share a similar silver-blue sheen. Since all four of these breeds have been around for so long that their ancestries are shrouded in legend and conjecture, a common ancestor is possible.

In 1871 a Russian Blue was shown at the first cat show at the Crystal Palace in London, under the name Archangel Cat. At this point, Russian Blues were shorthaired, solid blue felines with foreign body types. From photos and published sources of the time, the original coat was thick, dense, glossy, and colored a light silver-blue. Russian Blues competed in the same class with all other shorthaired blues, despite obvious differences in type. Since the round-headed, cobby British Blues were favored in the show halls, the slender Russian Blues rarely won.

Finally, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) acknowledged the breed, and in 1912 the Russian Blue was granted a class of its own. The breed then made progress until World War II when it almost became extinct, as did many other breeds.

The Russian Blue arrived in America in the early 1900s, but it was not until 1947 that serious attempts at breeding and promoting in the United States began. Russian Blues are now accepted for championship in all North American cat associations.","Body
Fine boned, long, firm, and muscular; lithe and graceful in outline and carriage without being tubular in appearance.

Smooth, medium wedge, neither long and tapering nor short and massive. Muzzle is blunt, and part of the total wedge, without exaggerated pinch or whisker break. Top of skull long and flat in profile, gently descending to slightly above the eyes, and continuing at a slight downward angle in a straight line to the tip of the nose. Medium in length. Length of top-head should be greater than length of nose. The face is broad across the eyes due to wide eyeset and thick fur. Muzzle smooth, flowing wedge without prominent whisker pads or whisker pinches. Neck long and slender, but appearing short due to thick fur and high placement of shoulder blades.

Ears
Rather large and wide at the base. Tips more pointed than rounded. The skin of the ears is thin and translucent, with little inside furnishing.

62,"The Scottish Fold cat occurred as a spontaneous mutation in farm cats in Scotland. The breed has been established by crosses to British Shorthair and domestic cats in Scotland and England. In America, the outcross is the American and British Shorthair. All bona fide Scottish Fold cats trace their pedigree to Susie.",Scottish Fold,"Scottish Folds are typically intelligent, sweet-tempered, soft-spoken, and easily adaptable to new people and situations. They are loyal and tend to bond with one person in the household. While they will usually allow others to cuddle and pet them, their primary attachment becomes quickly clear as they single out their chosen human. They thrive on attention, but it must be on their own terms. Despite their devotion, they are not clingy, demanding cats and usually prefer to be near you rather than on your lap. They enjoy a good game of catch the catnip mouse now and then as well, and keep their playful side well into adulthood.

Despite being folded, the Fold’s ears are still expressive and swivel to listen, lay back in anger, and prick up when a can of food is opened. The fold in the ear can become less pronounced when the cat is upset or ill. Although some Fold family members report an increased production of wax buildup in their cats’ ears, the folded ears typically do not make the cat more susceptible to mites or ear infections. The previously reported susceptibility to deafness may be related to the fact that some early Scottish Folds were white, and white cats can be prone to a type of deafness that’s unrelated to the Fold gene.","All Scottish Folds can trace their pedigrees back to a cat named Susie found in 1961 on the McRae farm near Coupar Angus, a town in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. This white female farm feline had unique, folded down ears, and British Shorthair breeders William and Mary Ross, upon seeing this unusual cat, recognized her potential as a new breed.

William Ross asked the McRaes if he could purchase the cat, and was promised a kitten from Susie’s first litter. Susie’s mother was a straight-eared white cat, and her father was unknown, so it’s unclear whether Susie was one of the first of her kind or whether the folded ears had never been noticed before. In 1963, Susie produced two folded-ear kittens, and as promised William and Mary Ross were given one—a folded-ear white beauty like her mother that they named Snooks.

On the advice of British geneticist Peter Dyte, the Rosses started a breeding program using as outcrosses the British Shorthairs that were close on hand in their cattery, and random-bred domestics. They took the name Denisla as their Fold cattery named after the two rivers, the Den and the Isla, which flowed past their cottage.

William and Mary Ross quickly realized that the gene governing the folded ears was dominant; only one parent needed the gene in order to pass along the unique trait. Any cat possessing one copy of the fold gene produced about fifty percent of Fold kittens.

Originally, the Rosses called their new breed Lops after the lop-ear type of rabbit. In 1966, however, they changed the name to Scottish Fold, in honor of this most extraordinary trait and the country in which the breed was found. The same year, the Rosses registered their Scottish Fold cats with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Along with other enthusiasts they gathered along the way, the Rosses began the process of achieving acceptance for their folded friends.

At first, a number of breeders and fanciers were enthusiastic about this new and different breed, but soon GCCF became concerned about potential health problems. At first, they were worried about ear infections, ear mite infestations, and deafness, but these concerns were proven unfounded. However, GCCF soon became concerned about genetic problems, which were, unfortunately, very real difficulties. By 1971, GCCF closed registration to Scottish Folds and banned further registration in their registry. To continue toward the show ring, the Scottish Fold had to pack up its kilts and move to North America.

All genuine Scottish Folds can be traced back to Susie. The Scottish Fold was accepted for CFA registration in 1973; in May 1977 Scottish Folds were given CFA provisional status. In 1978, the Fold became a CFA champion breed. In an amazingly short period, the Fold earned acceptance in all the North American cat associations and a place among North America’s most popular breeds. The longhaired version of the breed was not officially recognized until the mid-1980s, although longhair kittens had been cropping up in Scottish Fold litters since the genesis of the breed. Suzie may have carried the recessive gene for long hair, being a cat of uncertain origin.

The use of a number of Persians in early outcrosses also helped establish the longhair gene. Today, all associations have accepted the Scottish Fold Longhair for championship, although many associations have a separate standard for the longhair and call it the Highland Fold or the Longhair Fold. The Scottish Fold Longhair is known by three different monikers, depending on the association. AACE, ACFA, and UFO call the breed the Highland Fold; CFF refers to the breed as the Longhair Fold. In CFA and TICA, the longhaired Scottish Fold is a division of the Scottish Fold breed and shares one standard in each association. In CCA, the breed is called Scottish, and both hair lengths share one standard, although the two hair lengths are judged as separate breeds. In addition, CCA accepts the Scottish Straight Shorthair and the Scottish Straight Longhair under the name Scottish; these are Scottish Folds that don’t possess folded ears. The Scottish Shorthair, also called the pert-ear, has the same personality and body type as the Scottish Fold; they just don’t have folded ears. Since the Fold doesn’t breed true, the pet-quality pert-ear can be bought relatively inexpensively. In the Australian Cat Federation (ACF), the Scottish Shorthair is accepted as a breed in its own right.","Body

63,"The Selkirk Rex is the result of a dominant, spontaneous mutation that causes each hair (guard, down and awn) to have a gentle curl giving the coat a soft feel. The Selkirk Rex is a medium to large cat with heavy boning that gives the cat surprising weight and an impression of power.",Selkirk Rex,"One may be at first attracted to the Selkirk’s cute and curly exterior, but these cats also make champion companions.

Selkirks generally fit in well with other cats and dogs, and other family members. They have a wonderful affectionate, playful personality.","The Selkirk is the newest Rex breed to be recognized by the North American cat associations and has been around a relatively short time compared with the Cornish Rex and the Devon Rex. The Selkirk’s development and promotion were due primarily to the efforts of breeder Jeri Newman of the Noface Cattery in Livington, Montana, although many other dedicated breeders lent a hand in furthering the breed. Newman, a Persian breeder for many years, had always been fascinated by cats in general and feline genetics in particular, made it known to friends and family that she was interested in adopting cats that were in any way out of the ordinary. In 1987, the out-of-the-ordinary came to her.

At the For Pet’s Sake Animal Shelter in Sheridan, Montana, run out of the home of animal lover Kitty Garrett Brown, a cat gave birth to a litter of six—five kittens plus one kitten with a curly coat as plush and huggable as a child’s stuffed toy. Peggy Vorrhees of the Bozeman Humane Society of Sheridan, Montana brought the kitten to Jeri Newman because she thought Newman would be interested in the unusual-coated cat. Indeed she was. The blue-cream and white kitten with the alert green eyes and the extraordinary curly coat resembling lamb’s wool caught Newman’s immediate attention.

At an estimated age of ten months, the cat’s whiskers were curly, her ears were full of brillo-like hair, and her coat looked like she’d just had a perm. Newman named the cat Miss DePesto because she was always pestering Newman for attention. When “Pest” came of age, Newman bred her. The mating produced a litter of six, three of which had the distinctive curly coat. Since Newman had studied genetic inheritance, she knew this meant the gene governing the curly coat was dominant—only one parent needed to possess the gene for the trait to appear in at least some of the offspring. That litter also included one straight-haired kitten with long hair. Interesting, Newman thought. Not only did Pest carry the dominant curly-coat gene, but also the recessive gene for long hair, since both parents had to possess at least one copy of the longhair gene to produce longhaired offspring.

Newman named the breed the Selkirk Rex after her stepfather. However, for a time she said the breed was named after the Selkirk Mountains, because they were near where the kittens were born. However, when pointed out to her that the Selkirk Mountains were in British Columbia, she admitted to naming the breed after her stepfather; the Selkirk Rex is the only cat breed named after an individual.

The breed was presented to TICA’s board of directors in 1990 and was accepted into the New Breed and Color class. The CFA accepted the breed for registration in the miscellaneous class in 1992. The Selkirk advanced to CFA provisional status on May 1, 1998, and in 2000 achieved the CFA championship status.","Body

64,"The ideal Siamese is a medium-sized, svelte, refined cat with long tapering lines, very lithe but muscular. Males may be proportionately larger. Balance and refinement are the essence of the breed, where all parts come together in a harmonious whole, with neither too much nor too little consideration given to any one feature.",Siamese ,"Some cats seem to think that a purr or a friendly rub speaks louder than words. Meezers (as Siamese are affectionately called) are not of this school of thought and are known for their talent for clearly communicating their ideas and desires to their human servants. If you can’t be drawn into dialogue, they’re happy to keep up a running monologue for your enlightenment. No meaningless meows, these, but real attempts at communication, according to Siamese fans.

To some cat lovers, the Siamese rasp (some would say yowl) can be a bit annoying. However, Meezer worshippers wouldn’t have it any other way. According to fans, Meezers are the most wonderful, loving, entertaining cats in the known universe. Siamese are very intelligent, self-assured, playful, determined, curious, and highly active. They love their human companions with a passion; living with the Siamese is a bit like living with exceedingly active children. Except these “children” follow you everywhere, demanding to be involved in whatever you’re doing.

Determinedly social and very dependent upon their humans, Meezers crave active involvement in your life. They are super-intelligent and if you don’t give them something to do, they will find something to do that you may not approve of quite as much. This breed needs daily periods of play and interaction; it’s critical to the Siamese’s emotional and mental health and well-being. They should not be left alone for long periods; this is not a breed you can pat on the head and leave for twelve hours. Siamese will pine and become depressed if left too often alone, and may become destructive out of the frustrated craving for social interaction. The feline companionship of another Siamese or a comparatively active breed will help keep a lonely Siamese happy while you’re away, but there is no substitute for human interaction. Moreover, remember two Siamese can think up twice as much mischief to get into while you’re out earning the cat food.

This breed is not for those looking for a quiet companion—Siamese need to be treated with patience and require lots of attention and affection if they are to have the close, caring relationship they require with their human companions. For those who want a soul mate cat companion, however, this is your breed. Siamese are usually good family pets and are tolerant of children at least eight and older, as long as the children are taught how to properly handle cats and don’t play too rough.","The Siamese is one of the oldest breeds of domestic cat and has a history as long and colorful as the cat itself. The Siamese is also (arguably) the most recognizable breed on the planet. According to accounts, these sleek cats with the brilliant blue eyes and outspoken personality originated in Siam (now Thailand), where they lived in palaces and temples. They were treasured as companions of royalty and religious leaders for generations, and served as guardians of precious documents and valuables in the Buddhist temples.

These sacred cats were thought to inherit transmigrated souls en route to the hereafter. Early legends involving the Siamese are plentiful, including fanciful tales accounting for the cat’s traits. One such story tells how a Siamese temple cat, charged with guarding a valuable vase, curled its tail around the vase and stared at it with such intensity that its eyes became permanently crossed. Another tale tells of Siamese cats appointed to guard precious rings; the cats kept the rings on their tails and kinks developed to keep the rings from sliding off.

The Cat-Book Poems, a manuscript of verses and paintings written in the city of Ayutthaya, Siam, some time between 1350 c.e. when the kingdom was founded, and 1767 c.e. when the city was destroyed by invaders, clearly show cats with slim bodies and legs, and pale-colored coats with dark coloring on the ears, faces, tails, and feet. When the book was written can’t be more accurately determined since these manuscripts were handwritten on palm-leaf or bark parchment. When a manuscript became too old, it was painstakingly copied by hand when the original and subsequent copies became too old and fragile to be usable. This makes it difficult to date. Still, it’s likely the oldest document about cats in existence.

Because the Siamese was so valued in its native land the cats were rarely given to outsiders. However, it’s clear that by the 1800s the Siamese had been exported to Britain. Siamese cats were exhibited in 1871 in the first modern-style cat show at The Crystal Palace in Sydenham, London. At the event, one journalist of the time disparagingly described the breed as “an unnatural, nightmare kind of cat.” Despite this bad press, the Siamese rapidly became popular among British fanciers. At that time, the Siamese were noted for their crossed eyes and kinked tails; these didn’t become conformation faults until later. The first British standard, written in 1892 and rewritten in 1902, described the Siamese as a “striking-looking cat of medium size, if weighty, not showing bulk, as this would detract from the admired svelte appearance… also distinguished by a kink in the tail.”

Siamese must have become used to posh dwellings from its years with royalty; the first Siamese imported to North America lived in the White House. This well-documented account occurred in November of 1878, when David B. Sickels, a U.S. diplomat stationed at the consulate in Bangkok, sent a Siamese cat to first lady Lucy Hayes. In a letter that can be viewed in the Paper Trail archives of the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, Sickels wrote, “I have taken the liberty of forwarding you one of the finest specimens of Siamese cats that I have been able to procure in this country . . . I am informed that this is the first attempt ever made to send a Siamese cat to America.”

By the early 1900s, Siamese cats began appearing in North American cat shows. The breed rapidly clawed its way to the top of the cat fancy’s scratching post, and today is one of most popular shorthaired breed in North America. Due to its popularity, the breed has been used in the matrix of many modern cat breeds, including the Ocicat, Himalayan, Burmese, Tonkinese, and Oriental breeds, such as the Oriental Shorthair, Oriental Longhair, and the Balinese.

Although the Extreme Siamese is favored in the show ring, the Old-Style Siamese (known as the Thai in TICA and some of the European associations; see profile on page 270) has an enthusiastic following of breeders and fanciers who prefer this moderate type of Siamese. In some associations, the Thai is synonymous with “Old-Style Siamese”; CFF accepts the Old-Style Siamese for championship, and UFO accepts the Old-Style Siamese, the Old-Style Balinese, and the Old-Style Colorpoint for championship. Other fanciers refer to this type by the term “Applehead,” which is more colloquial and informal. These fanciers believe the Old-Style’s rounder, heavier body style is closer to the original type that existed before humans began selectively breeding for a svelte body style and elongated head type. Extreme breeders, on the other hand, believe that the Extreme body style is the original look, which became adulterated through dubious crosses in the early years. They are dedicated to preserving the natural, sleek elegance of the Extreme Siamese.

Extreme and Old-Style Siamese fanciers continue to hiss at each other over the difference in style, and it’s difficult to say who is correct. The illustrations of the Siamese in the Cat-Book Poems show cats with long, slender legs and tails; however, the body type could be interpreted as either Extreme or Old-Style, depending upon one’s point of view. Both sides agree on one thing, though: Siamese make wonderful companions.

If you’re looking for a cat with personality, an impish nature, and a talent for conversation, both the Extreme and the Old-Style will fit the bill. If you’re looking for success in the show ring, the Extreme is favored in many associations.","
Siamese cats are known for their sleek, slender bodies, elegant lines, and graceful posture. They have long, lithe frames, with fine bones and firm muscles, giving them a distinctive and regal appearance.

65,"he Siberian, Russia’s native forest cat, first appeared in recorded history around the year 1000 and hails from the unforgiving climate of Siberia. This is a cat that nature designed to survive, with no extremes in type. The Siberian is a medium to medium large, strong triple-coated cat with surprising heft for its size. The overall appearance should be one of strength, presence, and alertness, with a sweet facial expression. The breed is extremely slow to mature taking as long as 5 years.",Siberian ,"Siberians are affectionate cats with a good dose of personality and playfulness. They are amenable to handling, and it is noted that Siberians have a fascination with water, often dropping toys into their water dishes or investigating bathtubs before they’re dry. Siberians seem very intelligent, with the ability to problem-solve to get what they want.

Despite their size, they are very agile and are great jumpers, able to leap tall bookcases in a single bound. Siberians are very people-oriented, and need to be near their owners. They’ll meet you at the door when you come home and tell you about their day, and want to hear about yours.

Siberians are talkative but not nearly as chatty as Oriental breeds; they express themselves using quiet meows, trills, chirps, and lots of motorboat-type purring. They like sitting on your lap while they’re being groomed, an activity they particularly enjoy. Another favorite game is bringing a toy for you to throw again and again— and again. They love all types of toys— and will make a toy out of just about anything. Nature shows on TV with chirping birds or squeaking mice will bring your Siberians running; they’ll put gentle feet on the screen and try to catch the fluttering images.","This breed may be new to North America, but it’s far from new to the world. Longhaired Russian cats have been around for many hundreds of years. Exactly when and how longhaired cats made their way to Siberia is not known, but it is speculated that the breed arrived with Russian emigrants. According to some Siberian fanciers, Russians immigrating (or being exiled) to Siberia brought their cats with them. The mutation for long hair seems to have occurred in three separate areas—Russia, Persia (Iran), and Asia Minor (Turkey). However, it’s possible that the longhair mutation originally occurred in Russia and that Russian Longhairs spread from Russia into Turkey, crossbreeding with local cats to become the Angora, and into Persia, crossbreeding with local cats to become the Persian. If so, all longhairs are derived from the Russian Longhair.

Long fur in domestic cats appears to be an adaptation to cold, and it’s certainly cold in Siberia. Due to the merciless climate, these cats developed, or acquired through mating with the local cats, longer hair, all-weather coats, and larger, stockier bodies. The cats survived and developed into a hardy, longhaired breed able to withstand the unforgiving conditions of the region.

According to Russian stories, Siberian cats once weighed up to 45 pounds and protected their human companions and households. In Harrison Weir’s 1889 book, Our Cats and All About Them, he noted in the chapter on longhaired cats the varieties of longhaired cats that existed in his time, and were shown in his famous modern cat show in July 1871 at the Crystal Palace in London, were the Russian, Angora, Persian, and Indian. Weir, known as “the Father of the Cat Fancy,” wrote that the Russian Longhair differs from Angoras and Persians in a number of ways, including its larger size, longer mane, large prominent bright orange eyes, and its long, dense, woolly textured coat including the tail that’s thickly covered with very woolly hair. However, the Russian longhairs who shared the limelight at the show may or may not have been Siberians, since apparently no records of these cats were kept in Russia at that time.

Until the 1980s, the government of the former Soviet Union discouraged its citizens from owning household pets because of housing and food shortages. In 1987, the government lifted restrictions on house pets, and breeders and fanciers formed cat clubs and began keeping breeding records. In 1988, the first Russian cat show was held in Moscow. Terrell sent four Himalayans to Nelli Sachuk and in exchange received three Siberians on June 28, 1990—one male (Kaliostro Vasenjkovich) and two females (Ofelia Romanova and Naina Romanova). Soon after, she received the kittens’ metrukas (certificates of birth), which detailed their names, dates of birth, and colors and patterns. Before long, the Siberian had captivated Terrell’s heartstrings and purse strings. She invested thousands of dollars and expended many hours obtaining more cats and establishing the Siberian as a recognized breed in America. Just a month after Elizabeth Terrell received her Siberians, breeder David Boehm imported a number of Siberians of his own. Instead of waiting for cats to be sent, he booked a flight to Russia and bought every Siberian he could find. On July 4 he returned with a collection of fifteen cats. His Siberians produced the first litter in North America, and were invaluable in enlarging the Siberian gene pool.","Body

66,The appearance of an alert healthy small- to medium-sized muscular bodied cat with noticeably large eyes and ears in proportion to its head. Cat to have the illusion of refined delicate coloring.,Singapura,"The Singapura took its name from the Malay word for the Republic of Singapore, Singapura, which means “lion city.” That’s why Singapuras are known as little lions of love. Puras, happily unaware of the controversy that surrounded their creation, go right on being what they are: people pleasers.

At home in any situation, Puras love to be the center of attention, and they don’t seem to know the word stranger; they’re at the door with you to welcome anyone, whether they’re friends and family, or door to door salespeople. They’re curious, people-oriented, and remain playful well into old age. Their voices are quiet and unobtrusive, and they trust their humans implicitly.

Singapuras are not quite as active as Abyssinians, but they are plenty spirited nonetheless. These are busy cats with a daily agenda. They’re curious, affectionate, almost too intelligent, and are very much in tune with their favorite humans’ moods. They want to help with everything, whether you want them to or not. They help cook, clean, and help you make the beds as long as you don’t mind little furry lumps under the covers. Most important, they are as affectionate as they are active. As soon as a human friend provides an empty lap, they stop zipping around and settle in for a good session of petting, purring, forehead kisses, and loving looks from those large, liquid, trusting eyes.","Singapore, an island spanning 226 square miles (585 sq km) perched off the tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia, has scores of feral felines, as do many seaports. These cats make their livings off the leavings of the fishing trade, and in the past were not paid much attention unless they became nuisances. It is a hard life for these nomads and, far from being praised as pedigrees, they were disparagingly known as “drain” or “sewer” cats by the denizens of the island.

Small brown cats with ticked coats have been observed on the isle since at least 1965. This variety, however, is not the only kind of cat found on the island; other varieties include solid-colored cats, deeper-colored ticked cats that often have short, bobbed tails, and cats that display the white spotting factor. The Singapura breed as we know it in North America has made the Guinness Book of World Records as the smallest breed of domestic cat and had an advertising campaign centered around it to promote tourism to the Republic of Singapore.The Singapore tourist promotion board featured the Singapura as their national mascot, importing two Singapuras from the United States to serve as models for statues to represent “Singapore’s National Treasure.”","Body

67,"The combination of short hair, modified wedge, semi-foreign build, and particolor points sets the Snowshoe apart from other breeds. The Snowshoe is a strikingly marked cat in a variety of unique patterns.",Snowshoe,"Anyone looking for an aloof, standoffish cat need not apply for Snowshoe ownership— enthusiasts claim that Snowshoes don’t realize that they’re cats; instead, they consider themselves small, furry people.

The Snowshoe has an outgoing personality, although some cats may be somewhat shy with strangers, most get along well with other cats. They are outgoing, loyal, and make ideal companions. They love to perch beside you on the couch and touch you with a gentle paw until you get the message and give them some of the petting and pampering they’re due.

Very intelligent, Snowshoes can be taught a number of behaviors, such as fetch, but usually turn the tables and teach their owners a few tricks of their own, like getting out the treat sack on command. Snowshoes are also known for their fascination with water, particularly if it’s running. Turn on the faucet or flush the toilet and your Snowshoe will instantly materialize to stare with undivided fascination at the swirling water.

They also enjoy running off with small personal items and dunking them into the sink or their water dish. If you’re missing a sock, a pen, or other small item, first look in your Snowshoe’s water dish; it’s a favorite spot to deposit their finds. While not as loud or vocal as the Siamese, Snowshoes are never at a loss for words, but their voices are generally soft and melodic.","The Snowshoe is a beautiful blue-eyed breed that combines the best qualities of the vocal, supple Siamese and the easy-going, sturdy American Shorthair. This shorthaired breed makes a terrific companion.

The breed got its start at the end of the 1960s when Siamese breeder Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty of Kensing Cattery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, produced a litter that included three Siamese kittens with pure white mittens. Instead of giving away the mittened kittens, she decided to turn these mavericks into a breed. She set out to reproduce the look by breeding one of her sealpoint Siamese with a bicolor American Shorthair. The resulting offspring lacked the Siamese’s pointed pattern because both parents must have the recessive gene for the pattern to express in offspring. By breeding the resulting kittens back to Siamese mates, however, Hinds-Daugherty achieved the desired result—a pointed pattern cat with a middle of the road body style and four white mittens.

Continued crosses with American Shorthair bicolors added a white inverted V pattern on the nose and muzzle in some of the kittens, which Hinds-Daugherty thought was a charming variety. She named the new breed “Snowshoe” since the kittens looked like they had just romped through glistening snow.","Body

68,"The overall impression of the Somali is that of a well-proportioned medium to large cat, firm muscular development, lithe, showing an alert, lively interest in all surroundings, with an even disposition and easy to handle. The cat is to give the appearance of activity, sound health, and general vigor.",Somali,"Don’t get a Somali if you want a cat that can be taken for a furry doorstop, or if you want a cat that’s just going to lie around the house all day. With all the virtues of the Abyssinian and adorned by a gorgeous semi-long coat, the Somali is a beautiful and boisterous addition to any household.

Like the Abyssinian, the Somali is vigorous and animated, has a keen sense of feline humor, and a real need for play. Everything is a game to a Somali; some will play fetch, but many prefer to chase that ball down the hall and then bat it up and down, around and around, until it rolls back to your feet for you to throw again—and again. If it rolls under something from which they can’t retrieve it, then back they’ll come and give you a wide-eyed stare or a gentle tap so you’ll get up and put the ball back in play. Wands and fishing poles with feathers are a huge hit; you’ll need a lockable cupboard for when playtime is over.

Fanciers say the Somali shares more than just a passing resemblance to the wily fox; Somalis know more ways to get into adorable mischief than a barrel of foxes. How adorable you find their mischief often depends upon the hour—it’s less adorable when you’re jolted awake at 4:00 a.m. by the loud crash of a breakable knickknack hitting the floor. They are highly intelligent, which contributes to their talent for mischievous amusement. The Somali is active, curious, and high-spirited, and loves to prance around the house, opening cupboards and generally getting into trouble.

Their voices are soft, their minds active, and their food dishes always empty. They also tend to be determined cats; once they get an idea in their furry little heads, there’s no dissuading them. They’re not belligerent about that idea rolling around between their ears; they’re just tenacious. Somalis are people-oriented and affectionate, but are not lap cats. They don’t like to be cuddled and when picked up usually are all wiggles until you relent and put them down. When you’re relaxing on the couch, they prefer to be near rather than on you. They do, however, want to be involved in every aspect of your life. Open a drawer and your Somali will be there to peer in, and stick a curious paw inside, too. Somalis are the best home entertainment you can buy, and they are more like people than cats— small, hairy, hyperactive people. Very energetic and high spirited, Somalis cavort like kittens until well into old age.","No one knows for sure when and where the first Somali appeared; some proponents think that the long coat was a spontaneous natural mutation in the Abyssinian. Genetic studies indicate, however, that the Somali probably originated around the turn of the century in England when breeders, low on breeding stock, used longhaired cats in their Abyssinian breeding programs.

In the late 1910s and in the late 1940s, during the aftermath of World Wars I and II, when so many breeds had dwindled to near extinction, breeders were forced to mix other breeds into their Abyssinian bloodlines to keep the breed going. Raby Chuffa of Selene, a male Abyssinian that came to the United States from Britain in 1953, and that appears on the pedigrees of many Abyssinians, is considered the father of the Somali breed on this continent; all Canadian and American Somalis can be traced back to this cat.

Raby Chuffa’s pedigree can be traced back to Roverdale Purrkins, an English Abyssinian female whose dam, Mrs. Mews, was of unknown ancestry and probably carried the longhair gene. Mrs. Mews was given to breeder Janet Robertson by a sailor during WWII. Mrs. Mews later produced two kittens: Roverdale Purrkins, registered as an Abyssinian, and a black unregistered male. Robertson used Purrkins to start her Roverdale cattery. Her cats and other Abyssinians of British origin were exported to Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. When longhaired kittens cropped up in Abyssinian litters (possible whenever two Abyssinians carrying the recessive gene for long hair were bred together), the kittens were quietly given away, since no breeder wanted to be thought to have Abyssinian lines that were “tainted” with the longhair gene. It wasn’t until the 1960s that breeders, seeing the appeal of a longhaired version of a breed that was rapidly gaining popularity in North America, began seriously trying to turn these castaways into a breed of their own. At the same time, breeders in Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand began working with the new breed as well. Some Abyssinian breeders wanted nothing to do with these longhaired nonconformists and did not want to encourage the connection that the name “Longhaired Abyssinian” would produce.

Abyssinian breeder Evelyn Mague, one of the first U.S. breeders to work with the longhaired breed after finding two of her Abyssinians, Lynn-Lee’s Lord Dublin and Lo-Mi-R’s Trill-By, carried the longhair gene. She came up with the name “Somali” because Somalia borders Ethiopia, the country formerly called Abyssinia for which the Abyssinian was named. In 1972, Mague founded the Somali Cat Club of America and began bringing the Somali enthusiasts together. In 1975, the CFA-affiliated International Somali Cat Club was founded, and in 1979, the Somali earned championship status in the CFA.","Body

69,"The most distinctive feature of this cat is its appearance of hairlessness. The Sphynx is of medium size and body conformation with surprising weight for its size. The body feels warm and soft to the touch, with a skin texture akin to either a soft peach or a smooth nectarine. The Sphynx is sweet-tempered, lively, and amenable to handling.",Sphynx / Hairless,"To say Sphynxes are lively is an understatement; they perform monkey-like aerialist feats from the top of doorways and bookshelves. Very devoted and loyal, they follow their humans around, wagging their tails doggy fashion, kneading with their padded toes, and purring with delight at the joy of being near their beloved humans. They demand your unconditional attention and are as mischievous (and lovable) as children. And despite all that and their alien appearance, they are still entirely cats, with all the mystery and charm that has fascinated humankind for thousands of years. While the Sphynx may not be for everyone, its unique appearance and charming temperament has won it an active, enthusiastic following.","The Sphynx is not the first instance of hairlessness in domestic cats. This natural, spontaneous mutation has been seen in various locations around the world for more than a century, and probably much longer.

The Book of the Cat by Frances Simpson, published in 1903, mentioned a pair of gray and white hairless cats, Dick and Nellie, belonging to an Albuquerque, New Mexico cat lover named F. J. Shinick. Called the “Mexican Hairless,” these cats looked similar to today’s Sphynx, and supposedly were obtained from Indians around Albuquerque. According to Mr. Shinick’s letter, “The old Jesuit Fathers tell me they are the last of the Aztec breed known only in New Mexico.” It’s unknown if that was true, but Dick and Nellie died without producing offspring.

In 1950, a pair of Siamese cats in Paris, France, produced a litter that included three hairless kittens. The results were repeated in subsequent matings of the same pair, but breeding the parents to other Siamese cats produced no new hairless kittens. Other hairless felines turned up in Morocco, Australia, North Carolina, and, in 1966, in Roncesvalles, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where a pair of domestic shorthairs produced a litter that included a hairless kitten named Prune. A breeder obtained the parents and began a breeding program; the breed was named the Canadian Hairless. Prune was mated with his mother, which produced one hairless kitten.

In 1970, CFA granted provisional status to the breed. This line had a number of difficulties; the gene pool was limited, and some kittens died from undiagnosed health problems. In 1971, CFA withdrew the recognition due to the breed’s health problems. The last of Prune’s line was sent to Holland to Dr. Hugo Hernandez in the 1970s. In 1978 and 1980, two hairless female kittens believed to be related to Prune were found in Toronto. They were sent to Holland to be bred with Prune’s last surviving male descendant. One female conceived, but she lost the litter. None of Prune’s descendants went on to become the Sphynx breed we know today.

In 1975, Minnesota farm owners Milt and Ethelyn Pearson discovered a hairless kitten had been born to their normal-coated farm cat, Jezabelle. This kitten, named Epidermis, was joined the next year by another hairless kitten named Dermis. Both were sold to Oregon breeder Kim Mueske, who used the kittens to develop the Sphynx breed. Georgiana Gattenby of Brainerd, Minnesota, also worked with kittens from the Pearson line, using Cornish Rex as an outcross.

At almost the same time (1978), Siamese breeder Shirley Smith of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, found three hairless kittens on the streets of her neighborhood, which she named Bambi, Punkie, and Paloma. The descendants of Bambi, Punkie, and Paloma in Canada, along with the descendants of Epidermis and Dermis in Oregon, became the foundation of today’s Sphynx. The breed has made considerable strides since its inception.

While most fanciers have welcomed the Sphynx as unique and exotic, some members of the cat fancy wish that the Sphynx would put on some clothes. Like other breeds that have diverged from the basic design, the Sphynx has drawn some negative attention. In addition, the gene that governs hairlessness can be considered a genetic disorder, since the cat is more susceptible to both heat and cold. On the other hand, fanciers argue that we humans are more or less hairless compared with our closest relatives, and with a dap of sunscreen we manage to get by just fine.

Association acceptance followed the breed’s creation quite rapidly for such an unusual breed. TICA accepted the breed for championship in 1986. In 1992, CCA recognized the Sphynx for championship. In 1994, ACFA followed suit. In 1998, CFA recognized the new and improved Sphynx lines for registration and in 2002 accepted the breed for championship. The breed is now recognized by all North American cat associations, as well as Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) and the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in Europe.","Body

70,"When asked what breed their striped cat is, many people reply with ""Tabby."" However, like many common cat monikers (Tuxedo, Tortoiseshell, Calico, etc.) ""Tabby"" refers to the coat pattern, not a specific breed of cat. In fact, every feline has the tabby gene, but it does not present in the coat of every cat. To make things even more interesting, there are five types of Tabby markings: classic, mackerel, spotted, ticked and patched.

Tabbies are known for their stripes, swirls and spots, making up one of seemingly infinite color and pattern combinations. Their coats have one dominant color and stripes in the brown and black color families. Brown mackerel markings are most frequently seen.

Tabbies can easily be identified by their sweet nature and the legendary capital 'M' on their furry forehead.

Because many different breeds of cats sport the tabby coat, it's hard to generalize about their personalities. However, chances are almost certain that there’s a tabby for any type of family, including those with children and other pets.",Tabby,"Tabbies can range in personality just as they range in coat characteristics. Knowing a tabby’s breed may give you hints into the cat’s personality.

An Abyssinian tabby is very active—climbing high and enjoying a fun game of chase. They are also an affectionate breed and will seek out their parent’s attention often. Their brains need frequent stimulation or they may get a little mischievous.

An American Shorthair tabby likes attention but not too much attention. They are social and do well with strangers. They’ll even cuddle up with you but don’t pick them up and carry them around. They’d much prefer to snuggle!

Maine Coon tabbies go with the flow and do well with children. They’ll stay on the lookout and watch what the family is doing if everyone is busy and can’t give them some one-on-one love.

Found in more than 100 color and pattern combinations, the Oriental tabby cat breed loves a good conversation and being near their parents. They also like having a playmate around to keep their creativity and curiosity well fed.

Even though they look like a wild feline, the Ocicat tabby is one smart and social cat. They can be leash-trained and enjoy being carried. This breed typically sports a spotted tabby look.

One of the newer breeds, the American Curl is a tabby with adorable ears that curl back. They love their families, including children, and are okay being left alone if no one is available for some feline fun. Their coats come in a wide range of patterns.

For the most common types of cats—domestic short, medium and long hairs—the tabby look has no influence on their personality. These cats don’t claim to be a particular breed--they are just themselves! Their look and personalities are so varied they can’t be generalized. Regardless of their non-pedigreed background, these unique felines are valued by countless pet parents as cherished family members.","The Egyptian attribute the unmistakable ‘M’ on their worshipped tabby’s forehead to the cat’s Egyptian name “Mau.” The Islamic world believes tabby cats are born with an ‘M’ to remind the world of Mohammed’s love of cats. There is even a popular ‘M’ legend surrounding the birth of Jesus.

Upon his birth, Jesus lay in the manger shivering in the cold. Mary tried to keep him warm with blankets, and even beckoned the stable animals to come in close to help warm the baby with their body heat. It wasn’t until a tabby cat cuddled up in the manger with the newborn, that he was lulled to sleep with warmth and soft purring. This legend states that Mary placed the ‘M’ on the tabby’s forehead so the world would forever remember the day the tabby kindly comforted the baby Jesus.

Tabbies continue to play a big role in modern storytelling. Garfield the cat and Puss in Boots from the Shrek movies are both tabbies. More recently, the tiny brown tabby known as Lil BUB took over a good chunk of the internet. The Indiana native was the runt in a litter of feral cats found in a shed. Thanks to her awesome parent, Lil BUB helped raise big money to aid homeless pets and put the spotlight on pet adoption and special needs cats. Lil BUB’s was a one-of-a-kind cat, just as we’d expect from a tabby.","The different types and colors of cats have fascinated us for ages. Illustrator and cat enthusiast Harrison Weir’s book Our Cats and All About Them: Their Varieties, Habits, and Management; and for Show, the Standard of Excellence and Beauty was written all the way back in 1889 and is considered a classic.

Fur length and other details like facial structure, shape of ears and body type are often determined by the cat’s breed. However, regardless of breed, the tabby fur pattern essentially fall into five categories.

Classic tabbies are also known as the “blotched” tabbies. They have larger whorls that look like a target.

The mackerel has a ringed-tail and legs with stripes that travel around their entire body.

Push off the stripes! Spots are all the rage for the spotted tabby. The bands that travel the body of this tabby are not solid but are broken into spots instead.

Some tabbies try patches on for size. The patched tabby sports brown and red/orange patches. They resemble tortoiseshell, a colorful material used in manufacturing, and have been nicknamed Torti Tabbies, or Torbies.

Ticked tabbies have a subtler tabby patterning. Instead of bands of dark fur on their body, these tabbies have stripes or spots–called agouti–on each individual hair of their fur.

Regardless of their fur pattern, tabbies proudly wear the defining ‘M’ on their foreheads and a unique personality that is sure to find them their perfect home",1,../../../assets/cat-breeds/Tabb.png,9,10,9,15,4,3,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,,0,0,0,0

The Tonkinese is an alert, active cat with good muscular development. Tonkinese cats are very personable and are known for their good temperament and loyal companionship.",Tonkinese,"The Tonkinese has a winsome personality, not surprising since the Burmese and Siamese are prized for their temperaments. Faithful followers say the Tonkinese has the best of both breeds. Its voice is milder in tone than the Siamese; however, it does believe in feline free speech and wants to share all of the day’s adventures with you when you come home in the evening.

The Tonkinese craves, and returns, affection and companionship. Unlike the rest of your busy family, this cat will always join you for dinner. Tonks have an unflagging enthusiasm for life and life’s pleasures, and love interactive toys, such as human fingers and the tails of its cat companions. It makes every close encounter a game.

While Tonkinese cats willingly adapt to humans and animals alike, they may annoy more laid back pets and therefore might do better in a household with pets of a similar activity leve","While planned breeding of the Tonkinese didn’t begin until the 1960s, early versions of the breed in all probability have been around for hundreds of years. Since Burmese cats, originally called “copper cats” in their native land of Southeast Asia, existed in the same regions as the Siamese for centuries, planned or unintentional crosses seem likely. Solid brown (self-brown) cats and chocolate Siamese were among the first felines to come to England from Siam in the late 1800s, along with the blue-eyed sealpoint Siamese.

Early records describe the brown-colored cats as “Siamese, with coats of burnished chestnut, and greeny-blue eyes.” Researchers believe that these imports were not all of the same genetic types, but rather represent what today would be called Burmese, chocolate point Siamese, Tonkinese, and Havana Browns. At this point, it’s hard to tell one from another from the available descriptions. Ironically, Wong Mau, the Burmese’s foundation cat brought to the United States in 1930, was found to be a Siamese/Burmese hybrid and today would be considered a Tonkinese. These Siamese and solid-colored cats were exhibited in Europe during the late 1800s and the early 1900s. Soon after, however, such cats fell from grace. In 1930, the Siamese Cat Club announced, “The club much regrets it is unable to encourage the breeding of any but blue-eyed Siamese.” Solid-colored cats lacking blue eyes were accordingly banned from competition and disappeared from the cat fancy.

The Tonkinese got a fresh start as a recognized breed in the early 1960s, when Canadian breeder Margaret Conroy crossed a sable Burmese with a sealpoint Siamese. The product of the cross was a cat of intermediate temperament and type, which Conroy originally called the “Golden Siamese.” When the Tonkinese began, both the Burmese and the Siamese had not yet been transformed by selective breeding into their current conformations. The Siamese had yet to attain its extremely sleek show style, and the Burmese was not yet as compact and cobby, nor the head shape as broad and rounded. Still, combining the two and achieving a uniform and consistent head and body type was challenging for Tonkinese breeders.

To distinguish the breed from the Siamese, the name was changed to “Tonkanese” in 1967. In 1971 breeders voted to change the name to “Tonkinese” after the Bay of Tonkin off southern China and North Vietnam. The name was attractive and had a nice exotic ring to it, even though the breed did not come from the Bay of Tonkin area.

In collaboration with other notable breeders like Jane Barletta of New Jersey, Conroy wrote the first breed standard, which was presented to the Canadian Cat Association (CCA). The Tonkinese was the first breed to be developed in Canada. In 1971, CCA became the first cat registry to grant championship status to the Tonkinese. CFF recognized the Tonkinese in 1974; TICA followed in 1979, the year they formed as an association.

In October 1979, the CFA passed a “five-year rule,” requiring new breeds to remain in the newly established non-competition miscellaneous class for five years. The CFA granted the Tonkinese breed championship status in 1984. By 1990, all of the major associations had accepted the breed for championship.","Body

72,"The tortoiseshell cat gets its name from its complex colorations. Found in mosaic or chimera, regular or dilute combinations, this cat is so named due to the similarity in color to a once-popular manufacturing material called tortoiseshell. Because the term tortoiseshell, or “tortie” as their fans affectionately dubbed them, refers to the coat, the tortoiseshell cat is not actually a breed.

 

Tortoiseshells come in a fascinating mix of black hues with browns, oranges and reds sprinkled throughout. But it’s not just their coats that are complex. The tortie has been rumored to be the keeper of feisty “tortitude”—but is it true? We’ll let you be the judge.

 

This supposed tortitude is only one of many legends surrounding these beautiful felines. From the Celts to the Japanese, the tortoiseshell cat has a history as intricate as their coats! One rumor is untrue, however…some torties are in fact male.",Tortoiseshell ,"Calico and tortoiseshell cats are rumored to be a bit feistier than cats of other fur colors, and some research seem to confirm this. But just like the torti’s coat, the feline disposition is far more complex.

There are many factors that can contribute to a cat’s personality, including their breed and upbringing, the researchers were quick to point out. Since tortoiseshell is not a breed, it’s hard to generalize their disposition. As a general rule, it’s best to view each cat as an individual and get to know each one personally.

Even if studies report higher levels of attitude in torties, there are many devoted tortie-loving cat parents who avidly claim these cats are truly awesome. Torties have been described as fiercely loyal to their parent, spontaneous and decisive. Fine conversationalists, torties are also not shy in letting their families know what they need.

At the end of the day, “tortitude” may or may not be a thing for this bunch. Sassy or reserved, chatty or observant, these cats have personalities as varied as their coats. Their unwavering dedication to their family is second-to-none so tortitude may be a small price to pay for their heart-melting sincerity and uniqueness.","These cats are shrouded in rumors, legends and mystery. They are sometimes known as money cats and are a recognized symbol of good luck in numerous cultures around the world.

The Ancient Celts found fortune with the rare male tortoiseshell. If one spent the night, then the homeowners were bestowed good luck. Japanese fisherman banked on the male tortie’s powers too: they would bring them on board their ships to protect them from apparitions and storms.

Rumor also has it that if you dream of one of these beauties, love will strike.… so, sweet dreams.","BODY
A tortie cat has a 1/3000th chance of being male. That means over 99.9% of all tortoiseshell cats are female. The X chromosome of the cat creates the orange and black coat coloring that is the base of a tortie’s coat. Because females have the XX chromosome patterns, their two X’s can become co-dominant and produce a tortie kitty. Since males have the XY chromosomes, they can’t be tortie UNLESS they somehow end up with a genetic mutation and snag another X to then have an XXY pattern. So, torties are mostly, but not entirely, all gals.

Fur length and paw shape can vary greatly as these cats come in all sorts of breeds. The Maine Coon, Cornish Rex, Persian and Ragamuffin breeds have all sported the striking tortoiseshell fur. But even mixed-breed cats wear this fancy coat, including domestic short, medium and long hairs as well as tabbys—which are often referred to as torbies when their stripes or swirls are mixed with the tortoiseshell color.

Torties whose colors are displayed in larger sections are called “patched” while those whose colors interweave are “brindled.” The colors can also be integrated throughout the body (mosaic), or they can be split—one side of the cat’s body is one color and the other is another color. The split could also be between face and body.

The tortie also varies greatly in weight and lifespan., Tiffany Two, a California tortoiseshell cat, was named the currently-oldest living cat in 2015 by the Guinness World Records, at the very respectable age of 26.",1,../../../assets/cat-breeds/Tortoiseshell.png,8,10,7,12,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,0,0,0,0

74,"
A balanced, graceful cat with a fine, silky coat that shimmers with every movement, in contrast to the firm, long muscular body beneath it.",Turkish Angora,"Angoras seem to invoke strong responses in their humans with their symmetry, intelligence, and devotion. Angoras bond with their owners completely; an Angora is not happy unless they are right in the middle of whatever you’re doing. They enjoy a good conversation and can keep up their end of the discussion with the best of them.

Angoras are good-natured, but determined. Once an Angora gets an idea into their head, you might as well just give in and spare yourself the lengthy argument. Angoras have a great need to play and enjoy playing a good-natured joke on their favorite humans every now and then. They love practicing their pounce, on scraps of paper or unsuspecting human toes, whatever catches their fancy.

When in movement, which is most of the time, Angoras seem to flow with the grace of dancers. Highly intelligent, Angoras are problem solvers that like to be in control of their surroundings; they will only tolerate being held for a few minutes before jumping down to bat at sunbeams and chase feathers. They’ll stay in the room, though, so you can watch their antics admiringly. The Angora is known for its swimming prowess, and will even plunge in for an occasional swim. Not every Turkish Angora enjoys water, but some do, with varying degrees of enthusiasm.","No one is really sure how or where this ancient breed originated. Often recounted is the hypothesis that the Turkish Angora developed from the longhaired Pallas’s cat (Otocolobus manul), a small Asian wildcat about the size of the domestic, but this is doubtful. The Pallas’s cat has fundamental differences from the domestic feline and is unlikely to mate with domestics unless no other mates were available. Too, its differences would insure a number of generations of sterile males.

It is far more likely that the Turkish Angora developed from the African wildcat, like all other domestic cats. The recessive mutation for long hair in felines probably occurred as a spontaneous mutation centuries ago and was perpetuated through interbreeding in confined, mountainous areas that would limit outcrossing, such as regions in Turkey. The French naturalist De Buffon, writing in the later part of the 1700s, wrote that cats with long fur came from Asia Minor, a peninsula in southwestern Asia that forms the Asian part of Turkey. However they developed, longhaired cats have been noted in Turkey and the surrounding neighborhoods for centuries.

According to the legend, Mohammed (570–632 c.e.), founder of the Islamic faith, was so fond of cats that he once cut off his sleeve rather than disturb his beloved Angora Muezza, who was sleeping in his arms. Formerly called Ankara cats (the name of the Turkish capital was changed from Angora to Ankara in 1930), Ankara is also home to longhaired Angora rabbits and goats prized by the Turkish people for their long, fine hair. Longhaired cats were imported to Britain and France from Turkey, Persia, Russia, and Afghanistan as early as the late 1500s. The Angora had definitely found its way to Europe by the early 1600s, and by the late 1700s Angoras were being imported into America.

In the early days of the cat fancy, Angoras were highly prized. As the story goes, one Angora owner turned down an offer of ,000 for her favorite Angora at an 1890 cat show in London. Gradually, however, the Persian became the preferred type of cat in the European cat fancy. The Angora was used extensively in Persian breeding programs to add length and silkiness to the Persian coat. Later, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy decided that all longhaired breeds should be simply called “longhairs.” Also confusing was the tendency of cat fanciers to call any longhair a Persian or Angora, regardless of its bloodline. Persians, Angoras, and Russian Longhairs were bred together indiscriminately. Except in their native land, Angoras ceased to exist as a pure breed. They stopped appearing in the show halls and from registration records. By the 1900s, Angoras had virtually vanished.

In the early 1900s, the government of Turkey in conjunction with the Ankara Zoo began a meticulous breeding program to protect and preserve the pure white Angora cats with blue and amber eyes, a program that continues today. The zoo particularly prized the odd-eyed Angoras (cats with eyes of differing colors), because they are believed to be touched by Allah. Mohammed’s Angora, Muezza, was believed to be an odd-eyed cat. Because the Turkish people valued the cats so highly, obtaining Angoras was very difficult, but in 1962 Liesa F. Grant, wife of Army Colonel Walter Grant who was stationed in Turkey, was successful in exporting a pair of the zoo’s Turkish Angoras to America, complete with certificates of ancestry. These imports revived interest in the breed, and soon other breeders began going through the difficult process of exporting Angoras, and developing the breed.

A Turkish Angora breeder advertising “imported lines” usually means they have foundation stock from Turkey. The Grants were instrumental in achieving CFA recognition for the Angora. White Turkish Angoras were accepted for CFA registration in 1968, and for provisional competition in 1970, the first U.S. registry to do so. In 1972, white Angoras were accepted for championship competition. It wasn’t until 1978 that all the other Turkish Angora colors were accepted for championship competition like their all-white kin.","Body

Cartoons aside, tuxies have inherited more money than most people and have even gone to the top of Mount Everest!

These out-of-this-world tuxedo cats are a color pattern, not a breed. The bicolored sophisticated tuxies, as their fans call them, come in many different breeds with fur that’s long, short and everything in between. The common trait among them is their signature dark-over-white dress suit combination. Many tuxedos cats have additional gorgeous nuances to their coats, like blotches and mustaches, or other things to make you go “awwww.”

Tuxies have been loved and admired by some of the world’s top artists, musicians and politicians and are sure to be the purrfect addition to any family.",Tuxedo,"Though tuxie cats come in a variety of breeds, cat parents will tell you their sharp-dressing kitties share some of the same characteristics. Unlike tortoiseshell’s feisty tortitude, tuxies supposedly have a laid-back, friendly alternative: “tuxietude.”

Tuxies are all cuddles and purrs, making friends easily with just about anyone. They love a good play date. They are sharp as a tack and hit life milestones before other cats—tuxie kittens open their eyes 24 hours sooner than other cats!

They also have love for their parents. In 1601, the tuxedo kitty Trixy even followed her cat dad to prison and waited out the sentence with him.

Despite this reputation, it’s important that each tuxedo cat be viewed as and appreciated for the unique, special individual they each are!","Ancient Egyptians held high reverence for cats and even portrayed many of their goddesses as cats. As it turns out, approximately 70 percent of the tomb illustrations, hieroglyphics and other artwork found throughout the ancient Egyptian world are tuxies!

But their legacy and influence didn’t stop there—in fact, the Egyptians just got it started.

In more recent history, a tuxedo cat joined the race for mayor. Though he didn’t win the seat, Tuxedo Stan did draw awareness to the problem of homeless cats in his city of Halifax, Canada. He also helped secure a large grant from the city council to run a spay/neuter clinic.

Stan isn’t the only cat in the business of politics. Socks lived in The White House with the Clinton family during former president Bill Clinton’s term. Socks became so famous that he made it to the postage stamp of the country of Central African Republic and even had a cameo in a sitcom and cartoon strip.

The UK awarded their Dickin Medal to tuxie Simon due to his assistance to the British Royal Navy in 1949.

Henri, le Chat Noir, was a web series that starred the tuxedo Henri. One of his films was named the best among cat videos by Roger Ebert, which is no easy feat considering that cats own the internet and their videos are everywhere, all the time.

Sparky the tuxie received some $6 million as an inheritance in 1998—no other cat has inherited that much (and neither have most humans!)

Some of the best, more creative brains in history enjoyed the company of the tuxedo. Beethoven, Isaac Newton and Shakespeare all are reported to have these dapper cats as pets.

Tuxedos have been celebrated across time, across continents and across cultures—and we suspect they will continue to enjoy a level of fame and prestige other cat types may never see.

Guess it’s true what they say: clothes make the…cat.","Believe it or not, not all black and white cats are tuxies and not all tuxies have to be black and white—unless you are a tuxedo cat purist.

The classic tuxie is mostly black with white on the underside. Some even have a little white on their faces or a “bowtie” black splotch on their chest. This general patterning of the black and white is what gives these cats their adorable tuxedo title. Some gray, orange, silver, or even tortoiseshell cats are also called tuxedos by their doting cat-parents, if they have they have this special jacket-like pattern with white.

Coat

So how did these cats get their bicolored coats? Old science said it started in the embryo. Supposedly, the cells that give kitties their fur pigments were “slow” and didn’t reach the embryo before it fully formed. More recent researchers have disputed this. It is now thought that the cells in charge of pigmentation move randomly during development and don’t follow any instructions for the ultimate fur color. Essentially, their multiplication does not happen at a predictable rate.

Because tuxies appear in a variety of breeds, their fur can be long and silky, short and ruffled or anywhere in between! British Shorthair, Turkish Angora and Maine Coons (and many more breeds) can be tuxedo. They are also equally likely to be either male or female, with neither sex dominating in the tuxie sphere.

Their stylish suits also exude mystery. During an equinox, it’s said that tuxies seem to disappear because of their coloring. Some think this is some type of special tuxie magic!

,,,"Most Yorks enjoy being held and cuddled, on their own terms, of course, and are wonderful companions to the one special human person with whom they choose to bond. Although they are usually one-person cats and are intelligently cautious of strangers, they are friendly and affectionate to their extended family, including well-behaved children.","In 1985 Brownie taught her now-grown son Minky about the feline facts of life, and they produced two kittens: Teddy Bear, a longhaired brown male, and Cocoa, a longhaired brown and white female. By now, the farm had grown quite a crop of kitties with long lustrous coats. The farm’s owner, Janet Chiefari, was not only taken by the cats’ long, soft, richly colored coats and consistency of conformation, but also by their intelligence and sweet temperaments. As a goat farmer, Chiefari knew a lot about goats and goat breeding but little about cats and cat breeding; at the beginning she only knew that cats were adept at ridding her barns of rodents, and if left unaltered they multiplied quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"Ordinarily, they get along well with other pets, as long as the proper introductions are made. Intelligent and energetic, York Chocolates enjoy following their favorite humans from room to room to make sure all activities meet with cat approval. Yorks are also inquisitive and curious and insist on helping their preferred persons. Whether you’re reading the paper, folding clothes, or working at your desk, Yorks want to keep on top of things—literally.","Chiefari started reading every book on cat genetics she could find. By 1989, Chiefari had converted her porch into a cattery, which she named Upon the Rock. She created a breeding program using Brownie, Minky, Teddy Bear, Cocoa, and all of their chocolate-brown offspring. Chiefari placed the ten kittens she chose not to use in the breeding program with responsible homes. To Chiefari’s surprise the cats bred true, producing solid and bicolor longhaired brown cats with smooth, non-matting coats; Chiefari noted that their head shape, body type, and fur type were consistent from the beginning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"Yorks also have a fascination with water and take every opportunity to leap into the sink or tub, sometimes even when you’re trying to wash dishes or take a bath. Because of this breed’s barnyard background, Yorks are hardy and healthy and enjoy practicing their stalking skills whenever the chance presents itself -- indoors, of course. Therefore, Yorks are fond of toys that move, or in which you take an active role, and quickly become bored with playthings that just sit there.","Since long hair is governed by a recessive gene, and both parents had long hair, this meant each had two copies of the long hair gene. Therefore, the only possible outcome was longhaired kittens. In addition, Blacky and Smokey must have each possessed one copy of the dominant black gene (B) and one copy of the recessive brown allele (b) to produce Brownie; to express brown coloring, brown cats must inherit two copies of the b gene, one from each parent. After that point, whenever two brown cats were bred together, all the kittens were either brown or brown with white, depending upon the inheritance of the white spotting factor gene, which causes white mittens and patches of white.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"By summer of 1989 Chiefari’s cattery included twenty-seven longhaired solid brown or brown with white bicolor cats and kittens, and she was so enthusiastic about her new breed that she began to look for ways to promote them. In July 1989 Chiefari’s veterinarian introduced her to Nancy Belser, a cat breeder and judge for the Cat Fanciers’ Federation (CFF). Belser came out to the cattery and confirmed what Chiefari already believed—this breed was unlike any other in the cat fancy. Nancy Belser encouraged Chiefari to exhibit her cats in CFF. Chiefari’s background didn’t prepare her for the daunting task of starting a new cat breed, but she loved her cats and believed in them, so she jumped in with both feet. “Both feet, and total ignorance,” she noted in a later interview.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That September, Chiefari took Prince, a brown six-month-old male, to a CFF cat show and registered him in the household pet (HHP) kitten category. At that first show, Prince won four rosettes and took a first place trophy. Excited by the warm response and quick acceptance she received at that first show, Chiefari started the process of bringing the York Chocolate into the cat fancy limelight by applying for new breed status with CFF and ACFA. The breed still didn’t have a name, so after some thought she chose York Chocolate: “York” for her home state of New York and “Chocolate” for the breed’s characteristic coloring. With help from CFF and ACFA, she wrote the first breed standard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In March 1990, the York Chocolate was accepted as an experimental breed in both CFF and ACFA. Around the same time, the first lavender kitten was born. When a cat inherits two copies of the recessive dilute color gene d, one from each parent, instead of the dense gene D, the color brown becomes a soft gray known as lavender. Lavender and lavender bicolor were added to the standard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It takes more than one breeder to gain acceptance in the associations, so Chiefari began to recruit other breeders, relatives, friends, and neighbors; just about everyone Chiefari knew got a pitch about the joys of owning and breeding York Chocolates. The number of York Chocolate breeders increased, and just two years later, 1992, the York Chocolate was granted championship status in CFF. Canadian breeders Michèle and Frank Scott became involved with the breed, and together with other members of their newly formed York Chocolate Society were instrumental in gaining recognition with the Canadian Cat Association (CCA). In 1995, CCA granted championship status for the York Chocolate. However, CCA asked for minor wording changes in the standard, including that the York Chocolate Genetics Committee must give written approval for all domestic cats used as outcrosses in York Chocolate breeding programs. The main purpose of this rule was to prevent the sex-linked orange gene from becoming established in the breed, and was easily accepted by breeders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Anna and Francesco Baldi from Verona, Italy were the first European breeders of the York Chocolate. They purchased several York Chocolates from Michèle and Frank Scott in Canada, and Emile Belisle and Pat Chew in the United States to establish their cattery. Although the Baldis are no longer breeding, they were instrumental in creating the International York Chocolate Federation (IYCF), an Italian-based organization of breeders and fanciers dedicated to preserving and promoting the York Chocolate. In 1997 IYCF members and other breeders and fanciers were successful in gaining the York Chocolate’s acceptance with the World Cat Federation (WCF) based in Germany, and other international and European associations including the World Felinological Federation (WFF) in Moscow, Russia, the International Progressive Cat Breeders’ Alliance in Upton, Kentucky, and the Feline Federation Europe (FFE) in Nuremberg, Germany.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
