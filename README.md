The project presents a web application that facilitates the adoption of animals from adoption centers, using Spring Boot and Angular frameworks.The application contains authentication and authorization for users, providing a secure experience. Users can log in as suppliers, to manage their own animal center and adoption requests, or as normal users to explore animals from their favorite centers or receive recommendations of animals suitable for their lifestyle.
The adoption process is very efficient, through a form filled in by the user, who is then scheduled by the supplier for a visit to the center, to make the final  adoption decision. During this process, the user is constantly notified about the status of his adoption request. The application contains details about over 200 breeds of dogs and cats, as well as proper feeding and maintaining animalâ€™s health, being a complete guide for those who want to adopt an animal.
The introduction of the functionality of recommending suitable animals for the user could increase the interest for adoption, because users can view animals compatible with their preferences.
